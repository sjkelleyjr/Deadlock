# Writing Notes

## Character Names in Chapters

### IMPORTANT: Use First Names Only
When writing chapters, use first names only unless there's a formal context that requires last names:

**CORRECT (Use in Chapters):**
- Sarah (not "Sarah Mitchell" or "The Colonel")
- Vincent (not "Vincent Chen" or "The General") 
- David (not "David Thompson" or "Major Major")
- Michael (not "Michael O'Connor" or "The Chaplain")

**INCORRECT (Don't Use in Chapters):**
- ~~Sarah Mitchell~~ → Sarah
- ~~The Colonel~~ → Sarah
- ~~Vincent Chen~~ → Vincent
- ~~The General~~ → Vincent

### When to Use Last Names
- Formal presentations or board meetings
- Official documents or emails
- When characters are being introduced for the first time in a formal setting
- Legal or HR contexts where formality is required

### Why This Matters
- Most corporate interactions use first names
- Using last names in casual conversation feels unnatural
- It makes the dialogue more authentic to real corporate environments
- The MASH inspiration should stay in planning documents only

### Exception
- It's OK to use full names in planning documents, outlines, and character sheets
- The full names help us keep track of characters and their MASH inspiration
- But in actual chapters, stick to first names for natural dialogue

## Character Name Reference

### Main Characters
- **Alex** - The cynical analyst
- **Mack** (Marcus) - The rebellious ex-startup founder
- **Jordan** - The diplomatic self-taught programmer (whose attempts to smooth things over often backfire and create more work for him)

### Antagonists (Use First Names in Chapters)
- **Sarah** - Engineering Manager (MASH inspiration: The Colonel)
- **Vincent** - VP of Engineering (MASH inspiration: The General)
- **David** - HR Business Partner (MASH inspiration: Major Major)
- **Michael** - Technical Lead (MASH inspiration: The Chaplain)

### Innovation Lab
- **Lisa Chen** - Innovation Lab Team Lead (no relation to Alex) - Use "Lisa Chen" to distinguish from the other Sarah

## Other Writing Reminders

### Product Names
- Use "Taskly" for the internal project management system
- Don't use "JIRA" or "EnterpriseJIRA" - too obvious

### Tone Reminders
- Characters don't grow or collaborate - they just survive in their own ways
- No explicit statements about nothing changing at the end
- Focus on cynical camaraderie, not friendship
- Individual survival strategies, not coordinated resistance

### Chapter Structure
- Each chapter focuses on a specific corporate incident
- Characters respond individually to the same situation
- They share cynical observations but don't work together
- End with them continuing to survive in their own ways

### Dialogue Style
- Use first names in all casual conversation
- Keep dialogue natural and authentic to corporate environments
- Avoid formal titles unless the context requires them
- Remember that most corporate interactions are relatively informal

### AVOID REPETITIVE PHRASES
**Don't repeat the same phrases across chapters, especially tired corporate satire phrases.**

### Phrases to Avoid Repeating:
- ❌ "That's corporate speak for..." (overused and tired)
- ❌ "Velocity and throughput" (used in Chapter 1)
- ❌ "Brief" = "I'm going to talk for an hour" (used in Chapter 1)
- ❌ Any phrase that appears in multiple chapters

### What to Do Instead:
- ✅ Find fresh ways to express the same ideas
- ✅ Use different corporate buzzwords in each chapter
- ✅ Vary the cynical commentary style
- ✅ Let the absurdity speak for itself without explaining it
- ✅ Trust that readers understand the irony without spelling it out

### Key Principle
**Each chapter should feel fresh and avoid repeating the same jokes or phrases. The humor should come from the situation, not from tired corporate satire tropes.**

## Jordan's Comedic Dynamic

### The Diplomatic Backfire Pattern
Jordan's attempts to smooth things over and be diplomatic often backfire and create more work for him:

**Examples:**
- Chapter 1: Volunteers to "help coordinate the transition" → gets assigned to manage the Taskly rollout
- Future opportunities: Negotiating with vendors → gets put in charge of vendor relationships
- Mediating conflicts → becomes the go-to person for all disputes
- Suggesting "better approaches" → gets assigned to implement them

### How to Use This Pattern:
- Jordan tries to be helpful and diplomatic
- Management takes his suggestions as volunteering
- He gets assigned additional responsibilities
- He can't refuse without looking uncooperative
- The other engineers find it amusing but don't help

### Key Elements:
- Jordan's smile faltering when he realizes what he's done
- His reluctant acceptance: "I... of course. I'd be happy to help."
- The other characters' subtle amusement
- Management's enthusiasm for his "positive attitude"
- Jordan's internal frustration that he can't say no

### Why This Works:
- It's authentic to corporate environments where being helpful gets you more work
- It shows Jordan's genuine desire to be diplomatic backfiring
- It creates natural tension between his diplomatic nature and his workload
- It's funny because everyone can relate to this dynamic
