# Writing Notes

## Character Names in Chapters

### IMPORTANT: Use First Names Only
When writing chapters, use first names only unless there's a formal context that requires last names:

**CORRECT (Use in Chapters):**
- Sarah (not "Sarah Mitchell" or "The Colonel")
- Vincent (not "Vincent Chen" or "The General") 
- David (not "David Thompson" or "Major Major")
- Michael (not "Michael O'Connor" or "The Chaplain")

**INCORRECT (Don't Use in Chapters):**
- ~~Sarah Mitchell~~ → Sarah
- ~~The Colonel~~ → Sarah
- ~~Vincent Chen~~ → Vincent
- ~~The General~~ → Vincent

### When to Use Last Names
- Formal presentations or board meetings
- Official documents or emails
- When characters are being introduced for the first time in a formal setting
- Legal or HR contexts where formality is required

### Why This Matters
- Most corporate interactions use first names
- Using last names in casual conversation feels unnatural
- It makes the dialogue more authentic to real corporate environments
- The MASH inspiration should stay in planning documents only

### Exception
- It's OK to use full names in planning documents, outlines, and character sheets
- The full names help us keep track of characters and their MASH inspiration
- But in actual chapters, stick to first names for natural dialogue

## Character Name Reference

### Main Characters
- **Alex** - The cynical analyst
- **Mack** (Marcus) - The rebellious ex-startup founder
- **Jordan** - The diplomatic self-taught programmer (whose attempts to smooth things over often backfire and create more work for him)

### Antagonists (Use First Names in Chapters)
- **Sarah** - Engineering Manager (MASH inspiration: The Colonel)
- **Vincent** - VP of Engineering (MASH inspiration: The General)
- **David** - HR Business Partner (MASH inspiration: Major Major)
- **Michael** - Technical Lead (MASH inspiration: The Chaplain)

### Innovation Lab
- **Lisa Chen** - Innovation Lab Team Lead (no relation to Alex) - Use "Lisa Chen" to distinguish from the other Sarah

## Other Writing Reminders

### Product Names
- Use "Taskly" for the internal project management system
- Don't use "JIRA" or "EnterpriseJIRA" - too obvious

### Tone Reminders - UPDATED FOR ESCALATING STAKES
**For Corporate/Plot-Driven Chapters:**
- Characters start with individual survival strategies but are forced to adapt
- Their usual approaches become more dangerous and risky over time
- The company's dysfunction escalates to crisis levels
- They're eventually forced to work together when individual strategies fail
- Focus on escalating consequences, not just survival

**For Character Sketch Chapters:**
- Focus on character depth and personal life
- Show the human side of characters outside of work
- Can include character growth and reflection
- These chapters provide balance and humanity to the story

### Chapter Structure - UPDATED FOR ESCALATING STAKES
**For Corporate/Plot-Driven Chapters (1, 4-27):**
- Each chapter should build on previous chapters and have higher consequences
- Characters' previous victories should come back to haunt them
- Management should become more suspicious and desperate over time
- The company's dysfunction should reach crisis levels
- End with escalating tension, not just survival

**For Character Sketch Chapters (2-3):**
- Standalone character development pieces
- Focus on personal life and individual perspective
- No need to build on previous corporate events
- Can end with character reflection or personal moments
- These chapters provide depth and humanity to the characters

### Dialogue Style
- Use first names in all casual conversation
- Keep dialogue natural and authentic to corporate environments
- Avoid formal titles unless the context requires them
- Remember that most corporate interactions are relatively informal

### AVOID REPETITIVE PHRASES
**Don't repeat the same phrases across chapters, especially tired corporate satire phrases.**

### Phrases to Avoid Repeating:
- ❌ "That's corporate speak for..." (overused and tired)
- ❌ "Velocity and throughput" (used in Chapter 1)
- ❌ "Brief" = "I'm going to talk for an hour" (used in Chapter 1)
- ❌ Any phrase that appears in multiple chapters

### What to Do Instead:
- ✅ Find fresh ways to express the same ideas
- ✅ Use different corporate buzzwords in each chapter
- ✅ Vary the cynical commentary style
- ✅ Let the absurdity speak for itself without explaining it
- ✅ Trust that readers understand the irony without spelling it out

### Key Principle
**Each chapter should feel fresh and avoid repeating the same jokes or phrases. The humor should come from the situation, not from tired corporate satire tropes.**

## CHAPTER ENDINGS - CRITICAL GUIDELINES

### AVOID REPETITIVE/CHEESY ENDINGS AT ALL COSTS
**The rewrite struggled with repetitive, overly dramatic chapter endings. This is a major weakness to avoid.**

### What NOT to Do (Repetitive Dramatic Endings):
- ❌ "The [Initiative Name] was about to meet three engineers who had survived..." (repetitive setup)
- ❌ "This time wouldn't be different, but it might be more entertaining..." (formulaic)
- ❌ "[Company] was about to discover what happened when unstoppable corporate momentum met immovable engineering pragmatism" (overly dramatic)
- ❌ "Tomorrow would be interesting" (generic/meaningless)
- ❌ "It was going to be a beautiful disaster" (too obvious/telling)
- ❌ "None of them expected to change the system..." (preachy explanation)
- ❌ "But they could survive it, each in their own way..." (sentimental wrap-up)
- ❌ Any variation of "X was about to discover/meet/face Y" (dramatic foreshadowing)
- ❌ Repeating the same corporate initiative name multiple times in the ending

### What TO Do (Natural, Understated Endings):
- ✅ End with specific, concrete actions or details
- ✅ End mid-scene or with dialogue
- ✅ End with mundane, realistic details
- ✅ Let the situation speak for itself
- ✅ End abruptly without dramatic buildup
- ✅ Use specific filenames, actions, or observations
- ✅ Trust the reader to understand without explaining

### Examples of Good Endings:
- "Alex finished her technical assessment and saved it with the filename: 'Why_Taskly_Will_Fail_A_Technical_Analysis.md'"
- End with someone's specific action or observation
- End with a piece of dialogue
- End with a concrete detail about what someone is actually doing

### Key Principle for Endings
**End chapters like real life ends moments - abruptly, with specific details, without dramatic commentary. Avoid any temptation to "wrap up" or foreshadow dramatically.**

## Circular Reasoning and Catch-22 Logic

### Core Concept
**Incorporate circular reasoning and catch-22 logic that's central to Catch-22 into corporate conversations and processes.**

### Management Circular Logic Examples:
- "We need to increase productivity to justify the budget, but we need the budget to increase productivity"
- "You can't work on that project until it's approved, but it can't be approved until you show progress on it"
- "We need to reduce meetings to increase productivity, so let's have a meeting about reducing meetings"

### Bureaucratic Catch-22s:
- "You need manager approval to access the system, but you need system access to request manager approval"
- "The security policy requires you to change your password every 30 days, but you can't change it until you log in, and you can't log in because your password expired"
- "You can't submit your timesheet until you complete your tasks, but you can't complete your tasks until you log your time"

### Corporate Process Loops:
- "We need to document everything for compliance, but the documentation process is so complex it prevents us from doing the work we need to document"
- "The performance review system measures productivity, but filling out the performance review system takes so much time it reduces productivity"

### Character-Specific Circular Logic:

**Vincent's Innovation Loop:**
- "We need to innovate to stay competitive, but we can't take risks because we need to stay competitive"
- "You should think outside the box, but make sure you follow all the established processes"

**Sarah's Management Paradox:**
- "I need to protect my team from unreasonable demands, but I need to show I'm a team player by supporting management's unreasonable demands"

**David's HR Logic:**
- "We need to improve employee satisfaction to reduce turnover, but we can't spend money on improvements because turnover is too high"

### How to Use Circular Logic:
- Have management present these circular arguments with complete sincerity
- Let the engineers point out the logical flaws
- Show management doubling down on the circular logic when challenged
- Use these moments to escalate the absurdity and dysfunction
- The circular logic should become more extreme as the story progresses

## Jordan's Comedic Dynamic

### The Diplomatic Backfire Pattern
Jordan's attempts to smooth things over and be diplomatic often backfire and create more work for him:

**Examples:**
- Chapter 1: Volunteers to "help coordinate the transition" → gets assigned to manage the Taskly rollout
- Future opportunities: Negotiating with vendors → gets put in charge of vendor relationships
- Mediating conflicts → becomes the go-to person for all disputes
- Suggesting "better approaches" → gets assigned to implement them

### How to Use This Pattern:
- Jordan tries to be helpful and diplomatic
- Management takes his suggestions as volunteering
- He gets assigned additional responsibilities
- He can't refuse without looking uncooperative
- The other engineers find it amusing but don't help

### Key Elements:
- Jordan's smile faltering when he realizes what he's done
- His reluctant acceptance: "I... of course. I'd be happy to help."
- The other characters' subtle amusement
- Management's enthusiasm for his "positive attitude"
- Jordan's internal frustration that he can't say no

### Why This Works:
- It's authentic to corporate environments where being helpful gets you more work
- It shows Jordan's genuine desire to be diplomatic backfiring
- It creates natural tension between his diplomatic nature and his workload
- It's funny because everyone can relate to this dynamic
