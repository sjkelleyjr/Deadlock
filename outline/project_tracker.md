## Key Comedic Moments to Develop

### The Rube Goldberg Machine (Chapter 13)
- **Setup**: Simple "Export to CSV" feature request
- **Escalation**: Legal team demands extensive compliance requirements
- **Solution**: Mack builds over-engineered system with 5 microservices
- **Comedy**: 500+ lines of code for what should be 20 lines
- **Character Dynamics**: 
  - Alex provides cynical analysis
  - Mack embraces the absurdity with pride
  - Jordan sells it as "industry-leading compliance"

### Other High-Comedy Scenes
- **Chapter 2**: JIRA system built by their own company
- **Chapter 6**: Technical sabotage of team building exercises
- **Chapter 10**: Fake requirements to confuse consultants
- **Chapter 12**: Absurd innovation ideas that management loves

- Avoid repetitive phrases and formulaic endings 

## Situational Comedy Ideas for Future Chapters

### High-Comedy Scenes to Develop
- **The Innovation Workshop**: Management loves Mack's absurd ideas, rejects practical ones
- **The Performance Review**: David from HR conducts reviews based on arbitrary criteria
- **The Security Audit**: Finds violations in the most ridiculous places
- **The Team Building Exercise**: Mandatory "fun" activity that goes completely wrong
- **The All-Hands Q&A**: Vincent gets asked impossible questions, deflects with buzzwords
- **The Expense Report**: Rejected for trivial reasons, requires endless approvals
- **The Compliance Training**: Online course that's impossible to complete
- **The Office Move**: New seating arrangement that makes everything worse
- **The Vendor Demo**: Sales presentation that's completely disconnected from reality
- **The Emergency Response**: Crisis that requires immediate action but no one knows what to do

### Character-Specific Situations
- **Alex**: Technical reality vs. management expectations
- **Mack**: Rebellion schemes that backfire or succeed unexpectedly
- **Jordan**: Diplomatic attempts that make situations worse
- **Sarah**: Caught between team needs and management demands
- **David**: Endless escalation loops and bureaucratic paralysis
- **Michael**: Trying to protect team while keeping his job
- **Vincent**: Disconnected from reality, making impossible demands

### Technical Absurdity Scenarios
- Systems that require more work to use than they save
- "Automated" processes that need constant manual intervention
- Migration tools that break more than they fix
- Reporting systems that generate meaningless data
- Security requirements that make work impossible
- "Agile" processes that make everything slower
