# Final Approach: Deadlock

## Core Concept
A comedic novel about three engineers surviving corporate absurdity in their own ways, sharing cynical camaraderie without trying to change each other or the system. Inspired by the tone of *Catch-22* and *MASH*.

- **Survival Strategy**: Works around the system using logical analysis
- **Never Changes**: Remains cynical and analytical throughout
- **Signature**: "That's not a feature, that's a bug in our process."

### Marcus "Mack" Rodriguez (The Rebel)
- **Always**: Fights against stupid rules and processes
- **Survival Strategy**: Breaks the rules and gets away with it
- **Never Changes**: Remains rebellious and defiant throughout
- **Signature**: "I'm not causing trouble, I'm just pointing out the obvious."

### Jordan "Trap" Williams (The Diplomat)
- **Always**: Works within the system to get what he wants
- **Survival Strategy**: Negotiates and charms his way through bureaucracy
- **Never Changes**: Remains diplomatic and charming throughout
- **Signature**: "Let me handle this. I speak corporate."

## Key Principles

### No Character Growth

- They don't learn to work together or coordinate
- They don't change their fundamental approaches
- They just get better at their individual survival strategies

### No Collaboration
- They don't try to coordinate their resistance efforts
- They don't develop shared strategies or plans

### Cynical Camaraderie
- They bond over shared recognition of corporate absurdity
- They provide each other with humor and support
- They share cynical observations about situations
- But they don't try to change each other or the system

### Implicit Continuity
- The corporate system continues to be absurd
- No meaningful reforms are achieved
- The characters just find better ways to survive
- The ending shows them continuing to survive, not explicitly stating nothing changed

## Ending Approach

### Implicit Continuity

### Character Consistency
- Each character remains true to their core approach

This approach captures the authentic tone of *Catch-22* and *MASH* - characters who survive absurdity in their own ways, without trying to change each other or the system, finding humor and camaraderie in their shared recognition of the situation. The ending is subtle and implicit rather than explicit about the lack of change.
