# Chapter 13: Vincent's Vision

Vincent's day began at 6:00 AM with a cold shower and a protein shake that cost more than most people's lunch. He'd read somewhere that successful CEOs started their days early, and Vincent was nothing if not committed to being a successful CEO.

He opened his laptop and checked his calendar. Three back-to-back meetings before 10:00 AM, followed by a lunch with his venture capitalist friend, then more meetings until 6:00 PM. Perfect. Busy people were successful people.

His phone buzzed with a text from Preston, his VC friend: "Morning. Board meeting today. Need to discuss your 'innovation metrics.'"

Vincent smiled. Preston was always pushing him to be more "data-driven," but Vincent knew that true innovation couldn't be measured by traditional metrics. Innovation was about vision, about disrupting the status quo, about building something that would change the world.

He opened his email and saw the security audit report from yesterday. Greg had flagged several "concerns" about the engineering team's practices. Vincent skimmed through it, his eyes catching on phrases like "systematic deception" and "professional standards."

Interesting. The team was clearly trying to game the Innovation Score system. But instead of being concerned, Vincent felt a surge of pride. They were thinking outside the box, being creative, finding ways to work within the system while pushing its boundaries. That was exactly the kind of innovative thinking he wanted to encourage.

He forwarded the report to Sarah with a note: "Great work by the team! Their creative approach to the Innovation Score system shows exactly the kind of disruptive thinking we need. Let's discuss how to scale this across the organization."

At 8:00 AM, Vincent walked into his first meeting of the day. It was a quarterly planning session with the product team, and he was excited to share his latest vision.

"Good morning, everyone," he said, taking his seat at the head of the table. "I've been thinking about our product roadmap, and I have some revolutionary ideas to share."

The product manager, Lisa, opened her laptop. "Great, Vincent. We were actually hoping to discuss the current sprint priorities and—"

"Current sprint priorities?" Vincent laughed. "Lisa, we need to think bigger. Much bigger. I've been reading about quantum computing and AI, and I think we should pivot our entire product strategy."

Lisa blinked. "Pivot our entire product strategy?"

"Absolutely. Instead of building boring CRUD applications, we should be building the next generation of AI-powered productivity tools. Think about it - what if we could use machine learning to predict what users want before they even know they want it?"

The product team exchanged glances. Their current product was a project management tool that helped teams track tasks and deadlines. It was simple, functional, and actually worked.

"Vincent," Lisa said carefully, "our current product has a solid user base and steady growth. A complete pivot might be—"

"Disruptive? Exactly! That's what we need. Disruption. Innovation. Revolution." Vincent stood up and started pacing. "I want to see a prototype of an AI-powered task prediction system by next week."

"Next week?" Lisa's voice cracked slightly. "That's impossible. We'd need to—"

"Nothing is impossible if you have the right mindset," Vincent interrupted. "I read about a startup that built an entire AI platform in three days during a hackathon. If they can do it, so can we."

Lisa looked at her team. "Vincent, even if we could build something in a week, we'd need to consider user research, market validation, technical feasibility—"

"User research? Market validation?" Vincent waved his hand dismissively. "Those are the tools of the old way of thinking. True innovation comes from vision, from intuition, from knowing what the market needs before the market knows it needs it."

He sat back down and opened his laptop. "I've prepared a presentation on my vision. Let me walk you through it."

For the next thirty minutes, Vincent presented a series of slides that combined buzzwords, stock photos, and concepts he'd clearly copied from various tech blogs. The presentation included phrases like "paradigm shift," "disruptive innovation," "AI-first approach," and "quantum leap forward."

When he finished, the room was silent.

"Well?" Vincent asked. "What do you think?"

Lisa cleared her throat. "It's certainly... ambitious. But I have some concerns about the timeline and technical feasibility."

"Concerns are just opportunities in disguise," Vincent said. "I want to see progress by Friday. And remember - think big. Don't let conventional thinking limit your innovation."

At 10:30 AM, Vincent had his weekly one-on-one with Sarah. She looked tired, which Vincent took as a sign of dedication.

"Sarah, I've been reviewing the security audit report, and I have to say, I'm impressed with the team's creativity."

Sarah stared at him blankly. "You're impressed?"

"Absolutely! They found a way to work within the Innovation Score system while pushing its boundaries. That's exactly the kind of innovative thinking we need."

"Vincent, the auditor found that they've been systematically gaming the system with fake comments and misleading documentation."

"Gaming the system? Sarah, they're working the system. There's a difference. Gaming implies deception. Working implies creativity and resourcefulness."

Sarah rubbed her temples. "Vincent, they were adding fake AI and machine learning comments to simple arithmetic functions. That's not innovation - that's deception."

"Deception? Or creative problem-solving? They were given an impossible system and found a way to make it work. That's exactly what entrepreneurs do every day."

"Entrepreneurs don't lie to their investors."

"Investors don't understand the technical details anyway. What matters is the vision, the potential, the disruptive potential."

Sarah felt a headache coming on. "Vincent, the security audit also found real security issues. No branch protection, plain text passwords, inadequate code review processes."

"Security issues? Or opportunities for improvement? Every challenge is an opportunity in disguise."

"These aren't opportunities - they're actual security risks that could compromise our entire system."

Vincent leaned back in his chair. "Sarah, I think you're being too negative. The team is showing exactly the kind of innovative thinking we need. Instead of punishing them, we should be celebrating their creativity."

"Celebrating them for lying to management?"

"Celebrating them for finding solutions to impossible problems. That's what innovation is all about."

Sarah felt her frustration building. "Vincent, we need to address these security issues immediately. The auditor is filing a report with the board."

"The board? Perfect! This is exactly the kind of story we need to tell. A team that refused to be limited by conventional thinking, that found creative solutions to impossible challenges, that pushed the boundaries of what's possible."

"Vincent, this isn't a story - it's a security audit that found serious problems."

"Problems are just opportunities that haven't been properly framed yet. I want you to work with the team to turn this into a case study of innovative problem-solving."

Sarah stared at him in disbelief. "You want me to turn a security audit failure into a case study?"

"Exactly! Show how the team used creative thinking to work within an impossible system. It's perfect PR material."

"PR material? Vincent, this could cost people their jobs."

"Jobs? Sarah, you're thinking too small. This could be the story that launches us into the next phase of our company's evolution. Think about the headlines: 'ByteSauce Engineers Revolutionize Corporate Innovation Through Creative Problem-Solving.'"

Sarah felt her world tilting. "Vincent, I think we need to focus on fixing the actual security issues."

"Of course, of course. But let's do it innovatively. Maybe we can turn the security improvements into another case study. 'How ByteSauce Revolutionized Corporate Security Through Disruptive Innovation.'"

Sarah stood up. "Vincent, I need to go. I have a meeting with the engineering team to discuss the security audit findings."

"Perfect! Tell them I'm excited about their innovative approach. And remind them that every challenge is an opportunity for disruption."

As Sarah left his office, Vincent opened his laptop and started drafting an email to Preston about the team's "innovative problem-solving approach." This was exactly the kind of story that would impress the board.

At 12:30 PM, Vincent met Preston for lunch at an expensive restaurant downtown. Preston was already there, scrolling through his phone and looking concerned.

"You're late," Preston said as Vincent sat down.

"Sorry, got caught up in a fascinating discussion about innovative problem-solving. You won't believe what the engineering team has been up to."

Preston put down his phone. "I got the security audit report this morning. Vincent, this is serious."

"Serious? Preston, this is revolutionary! The team found a way to work within an impossible system. That's exactly the kind of innovative thinking that makes startups successful."

"Vincent, they were lying to management. Adding fake comments to code. That's not innovation - that's fraud."

"Fraud? That's such a harsh word. They were being creative, finding solutions to impossible problems. That's what entrepreneurs do."

Preston leaned forward. "Vincent, the board is concerned. We've invested millions in this company, and now we're finding out that the engineering team has been systematically deceiving management."

"Deceiving? Or innovating? There's a fine line between the two. The best entrepreneurs know how to work within impossible constraints."

"Vincent, this isn't about entrepreneurship - it's about basic professional standards. The board wants to see immediate action."

"Action? Of course! I'm already working on a plan to turn this into a case study of innovative problem-solving."

Preston stared at him. "A case study? Vincent, the board wants people fired."

"Fired? Preston, you're not thinking like an entrepreneur. These engineers are exactly the kind of creative problem-solvers we need. They found a way to work within an impossible system. That's innovation!"

"Vincent, the board is serious. If you don't take immediate action, they're going to replace you."

Vincent felt a flash of anger. "Replace me? Preston, I built this company. I have the vision. I understand innovation. The board doesn't understand what it takes to be truly disruptive."

"Vincent, the board understands that lying to management is not an acceptable business practice."

"An acceptable business practice? Preston, you sound like a corporate drone. True innovation doesn't follow rules. It breaks them. It disrupts them. It revolutionizes them."

Preston sighed. "Vincent, you're not listening. The board wants action. Real action. Not more talk about innovation and disruption."

Vincent felt his vision blurring. "Preston, you don't understand. This is exactly the kind of story that makes companies legendary. The team that refused to be limited by conventional thinking. The engineers who found creative solutions to impossible problems."

"Vincent, the only thing that's impossible is getting you to see reality."

"Reality? Reality is what we make it. That's what innovation is all about."

Preston stood up. "Vincent, I have to go. I have a board meeting in an hour. But I'm telling you - if you don't take immediate action on this security audit, you're going to lose everything."

As Preston left, Vincent sat alone at the table, his vision of the future growing more vivid and more disconnected from reality with each passing moment.

At 3:00 PM, Vincent called an emergency all-hands meeting. The entire company gathered in the conference room, and Vincent stood at the front with a look of determination on his face.

"Team, I have an important announcement to make. The security audit has revealed something extraordinary about our engineering team."

The engineers exchanged nervous glances. This was it - they were going to be fired.

"Your innovative approach to the Innovation Score system has shown exactly the kind of creative problem-solving that makes companies legendary."

The room fell silent.

"Instead of being limited by conventional thinking, you found a way to work within an impossible system. You showed that true innovation doesn't follow rules - it breaks them."

Sarah stared at Vincent in disbelief. This was not the response she'd expected.

"Starting today, I want every team in the company to adopt the same innovative approach. I want to see creative problem-solving in every department. I want to see disruption in every process. I want to see revolution in every meeting."

The engineers looked at each other, unsure whether to be relieved or terrified.

"Vincent," Sarah said carefully, "I think we need to address the actual security issues that were found."

"Security issues? Sarah, you're still thinking like a corporate manager. These aren't issues - they're opportunities for innovation. Let's turn every security challenge into a case study of creative problem-solving."

The room was silent except for the sound of people shifting uncomfortably in their seats.

"Team, I want you to know that I'm proud of your innovative spirit. You've shown that ByteSauce is not just a company - it's a movement. A revolution. A disruption of the status quo."

As Vincent continued his speech about innovation and disruption, the engineers exchanged glances. They had just been praised for their deception, and now every team in the company was being told to follow their example.

The meeting ended with Vincent's promise to personally mentor each department in the art of "disruptive innovation."
