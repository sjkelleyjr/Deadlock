# Chapter 4

The conference room smelled like industrial carpet and the lingering ghost of someone's microwaved fish lunch. Alex sat across from David Thompson, who had arranged his materials with the precision of someone who'd done this exact same meeting forty-three times in the past two weeks.

David opened his laptop and consulted a printed checklist. "Alex, thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. I know performance review season can feel overwhelming, but I want you to know this is really an opportunity for us to celebrate your contributions and identify areas for continued growth."

Alex nodded and folded her hands in her lap. She'd learned that looking attentive but not overly engaged was the sweet spot for these conversations.

"Let me start by saying that your technical skills continue to be a real asset to the team," David said, reading from what was clearly a template. "Your ability to debug complex systems and deliver quality code is something we really value here at ByteSauce."

Alex recognized the phrasing from last year's review. Possibly word-for-word.

"That said," David continued, "I think there are some opportunities for you to stretch yourself in terms of stakeholder communication and cross-functional collaboration."

"Can you give me a specific example of where my stakeholder communication has been lacking?" Alex asked.

David consulted his notes. "Well, it's more about... proactive engagement with the broader company ecosystem. Really leaning into those opportunities to interface with different business units."

Alex waited for him to continue. He didn't.

"I see," she said. "And what would proactive engagement look like in practice?"

"Great question. I think it's really about... visibility. Making sure your contributions are seen across the organization. Maybe volunteering for cross-team initiatives or taking on some of those stretch assignments that really showcase your capabilities."

Alex nodded. She was beginning to understand why these meetings were scheduled for thirty minutes when the actual content could fit in a three-sentence email.

David moved to the next section of his checklist. "In terms of your goals for the coming year, I'd love to see you focus on thought leadership and strategic thinking. Really positioning yourself as someone who can see the big picture and drive innovation across the platform."

"What kind of innovation are we talking about?"

"Well, that's really up to you. The best innovations come from individual contributors who are close to the technical challenges. I'm sure you have ideas about how we could optimize our processes or leverage new technologies."

Alex stared at him. "Are you asking me to come up with my own performance goals?"

"I'm asking you to think strategically about where you want to take your career. What excites you? What are you passionate about?"

Alex considered several responses, most of which would end this meeting prematurely and possibly lead to termination. "I'm passionate about writing code that works and solving problems that actually need solving."

David made a note. "That's great. So maybe we could frame that as 'driving technical excellence through solution-oriented thinking' for your development plan."

"Sure," Alex said.

The conversation continued for another twenty minutes, with David working through his checklist of required topics: career aspirations, learning opportunities, feedback on management, and something called "cultural alignment" that seemed to involve buzzword bingo.

By the end, Alex had been rated "meets expectations" in all categories, given improvement goals that were indistinguishable from everyone else's, and asked to sign a form acknowledging that she'd received "meaningful feedback" about her performance.

"Any questions about the process?" David asked as he gathered his papers.

"Just one. Do you actually read these reviews, or do they go directly into a filing system somewhere?"

David looked uncomfortable. "Of course I read them. This feedback goes into your permanent record and helps inform decisions about promotions, salary adjustments, and development opportunities."

Alex nodded and left the conference room, passing Mack in the hallway. He was carrying his laptop and wearing the expression of someone walking toward his own execution.

"How'd it go?" he asked.

"I need to focus on stakeholder communication and strategic thinking," Alex said. "You?"

"Haven't gone yet, but I'm guessing I need to focus on stakeholder communication and strategic thinking."

"Probably."

Two hours later, Mack emerged from the same conference room looking exactly as predicted.

"Let me guess," Alex said when he found her at her desk. "Stakeholder communication and strategic thinking?"

"Plus something about 'leveraging my technical expertise to drive cross-functional innovation.'" Mack sat down at his desk and opened Slack. "I'm supposed to identify stretch opportunities that align with my passion for problem-solving."

Jordan appeared with his own laptop and the slightly shell-shocked expression of someone who'd just been told his strengths were also his weaknesses.

"Strategic thinking?" Alex asked.

"Strategic thinking," Jordan confirmed. "Also stakeholder communication, even though my job is literally stakeholder communication."

"Did he ask you what you're passionate about?" Mack asked.

"He asked me to think about how I could 'amplify my impact across the organization through thought leadership and innovative collaboration.'"

Alex opened a new document and started typing. "Performance Review Bingo," she titled it, then added: "Strategic thinking, stakeholder communication, thought leadership, cross-functional collaboration, leveraging expertise, amplifying impact."

"Don't forget 'stretch opportunities,'" Mack said.

"And 'solution-oriented thinking,'" Jordan added.

Alex added both to the list. "Anyone get specific feedback about anything they actually did this year?"

"I got praised for my 'technical acumen,'" Mack said. "Which I think means I know how to use a computer."

"I got commended for my 'collaborative approach to problem-solving,'" Jordan said. "Which apparently means I attend meetings without complaining."

"I got recognized for my 'commitment to quality deliverables,'" Alex said. "Which means I turn in my assignments on time."

They sat in comfortable silence, each processing the experience of being evaluated by someone who couldn't describe what they actually did for work.

"You know what's funny?" Jordan said finally. "I've been here two years, and this is the first time David has asked me what I'm working on."

"Did you tell him?" Alex asked.

"I tried to explain the deployment pipeline automation, but he kept nodding and saying 'that sounds very technical' until I gave up."

Mack laughed. "I told him about the monitoring system I built, and he asked if it was 'aligned with our digital transformation objectives.'"

"What did you say?"

"I said yes, because everything is aligned with our digital transformation objectives if you define the terms broadly enough."

Alex minimized her Performance Review Bingo document and opened her actual work. Three bug reports, two feature requests, and a deployment that needed to happen before end of day. Real problems with specific solutions, unlike the vague improvement goals she'd just been assigned.

Her phone buzzed with a message from Michael: "Can you stop by my office when you have a minute? Want to debrief on the review process."

Alex walked to Michael's office, where she found him staring at a spreadsheet with the intensity of someone trying to solve a particularly difficult puzzle.

"How'd your review go?" he asked without looking up.

"I need to focus on strategic thinking and stakeholder communication. You?"

Michael finally looked at her. "I had to give you that feedback. David sent me a template with required improvement areas for all the senior engineers."

Alex sat down. "So the feedback wasn't actually based on my performance?"

"The feedback was based on corporate initiatives that HR wants to promote this year. Strategic thinking is code for 'attend more planning meetings.' Stakeholder communication means 'interface with business units so engineering looks more collaborative.'"

"And if I'd had a terrible year? Would the feedback have been different?"

Michael consulted his spreadsheet. "I can adjust the ratings, but the improvement areas are standardized. Everyone gets the same development goals because they're tied to company-wide objectives, not individual performance."

Alex studied the spreadsheet, which had columns for each team member and rows for different feedback categories. Most of the cells contained identical text.

"This is why you looked miserable during the leadership meeting last week," she said.

"I spent six hours writing individualized feedback for my team. David told me it was too specific and asked me to use the approved language instead."

"What was wrong with specific feedback?"

"It creates 'inconsistent messaging' across the organization. HR wants everyone to get the same development opportunities so no one can claim the process is unfair."

Alex leaned back in her chair. "So the performance review process is designed to be meaningless."

"The performance review process is designed to be defensible. If everyone gets the same feedback, no one can sue for discrimination."

"But it doesn't actually help anyone improve their performance."

"That's not the primary objective," Michael said. "The primary objective is compliance with HR policies and legal requirements."

Alex stood up to leave. "Thanks for being honest about it."

"For what it's worth," Michael said, "you're doing excellent work. The Taskly analysis you put together was exactly what I needed to push back on some of Vincent's more unrealistic expectations."

"Did the pushback work?"

"Vincent thanked me for the 'detailed technical assessment' and asked when we could schedule the migration."

Alex walked back to her desk, where she found Mack and Jordan comparing their performance review documents.

"Michael just told me the feedback is templated," she said.

"All of it?" Jordan asked.

"The improvement areas are identical for everyone at our level. The ratings can vary, but the development goals are standardized."

Mack looked at his review form. "So when David asked me what I'm passionate about, he already knew what my improvement goals were going to be?"

"Apparently."

Jordan shook his head. "I spent an hour preparing for that meeting. I had examples of projects I'd worked on, metrics about my contributions, ideas for how I could grow in the role."

"Did you share any of that?" Alex asked.

"I tried, but David kept steering the conversation back to his checklist. Every time I mentioned something specific, he'd nod and say 'that's great' and move to the next question."

Alex opened her laptop and pulled up the performance review document she'd been asked to sign. Under "Employee Comments," she typed: "I acknowledge that this review process is designed for HR compliance rather than performance improvement, and I understand that my development goals are standardized rather than individualized."

She saved the document and submitted it through the HR portal.

"What did you write in the comments section?" Mack asked.

"The truth."

"Think that'll cause problems?"

"Probably. But at least it's documented."

Jordan was still staring at his review form. "You know what bothers me most? I actually wanted feedback. I wanted to know what I could do better, what opportunities I should pursue, how I could contribute more effectively."

"And instead you got a form letter," Alex said.

"Instead I got a form letter that I'm supposed to pretend is personalized guidance for my career development."

Mack closed his laptop. "Well, at least we're all focusing on the same thing this year. Strategic thinking and stakeholder communication for everyone."

"Don't forget thought leadership," Jordan added.

"How could I forget thought leadership?"

Alex looked around at her teammates—people she genuinely respected, who did excellent work, who deserved better than corporate theater disguised as professional development.

"Same time next year?" she asked.

"Same time next year," Mack confirmed.

"With the same feedback," Jordan added.

Alex opened her calendar and created a recurring meeting for next October: "Performance Review Bingo - Annual Edition."
