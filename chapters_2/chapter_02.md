# Chapter 2

Sarah's alarm went off at 5:47 AM, thirteen minutes before her phone's scheduled wake-up call. She'd been lying awake since 5:30, mentally rehearsing the Taskly migration talking points she'd practiced in the shower the night before.

Her husband Mark was still asleep, one arm draped over the pillow where she'd been lying. She slipped out of bed quietly, grabbed her phone, and padded to the kitchen in her slippers. The coffee maker was already programmed—she'd set it up before bed, along with laying out her clothes and charging her laptop.

While the coffee brewed, she opened her laptop and scanned her email. Forty-seven new messages since 10 PM. Three from Vincent marked "URGENT," two from the Innovation Lab, and a string of replies to the all-hands announcement that made her stomach tighten.

The first urgent email from Vincent was timestamped 11:43 PM: "Sarah—need adoption metrics by EOD tomorrow. Board wants to see traction on internal tools initiative. This is critical for Q4 budget discussions."

She poured her coffee into the travel mug that read "World's Best Mom"—a Mother's Day gift from Emma last year—and started typing her response. "Vincent—understood. I'll have preliminary numbers by 3 PM and full analysis by close of business."

Her phone buzzed with a text from her mother: "Don't forget Emma's recital is Thursday at 7. You missed the last one."

Sarah stared at the message. Thursday. She had the quarterly planning meeting with Vincent at 6:30. She'd already rescheduled it twice.

She typed back: "Wouldn't miss it! Looking forward to hearing her play."

The Innovation Lab emails were from Lisa Chen, asking for "feedback on user experience" and "insights into adoption challenges." Sarah translated this as: please help us figure out why nobody wants to use our system.

She opened her calendar while walking to the bedroom to get dressed. Back-to-back meetings from 8 AM to 6 PM, with a working lunch to review the Taskly training materials. Somewhere in there, she needed to check on her team, review the migration progress, and prepare metrics that would make Vincent happy without being completely fictional.

Mark stirred as she was putting on her blazer. "Early day again?"

"Taskly migration," she said, checking her reflection in the dresser mirror. Professional but approachable. Authoritative but not intimidating. The balance was exhausting.

"That the new system you were complaining about?"

She paused. Had she been complaining? She tried to be careful about bringing work stress home, but lately the lines were blurring.

"It's not complaining. It's... strategic concern."

Mark sat up, rubbing his eyes. "Em's got soccer practice at 4 today. Can you pick her up?"

Sarah's stomach dropped. Soccer practice. She'd completely forgotten, and her calendar was blocked solid until 7 PM.

"We'll figure something out," she said, kissing him on the forehead. "Maybe ask your mom?"

"She's been picking her up a lot lately."

Sarah was already calculating. If she moved the 4:30 vendor call to 5 PM and took the training review as a walking meeting...

"I'll handle it," she said.

The drive to ByteSauce took thirty-two minutes, during which she listened to a leadership podcast about "Managing Through Uncertainty" and practiced her responses to potential pushback about the migration timeline. By the time she parked, she had her talking points memorized and her game face on.

The elevator was crowded with engineers who went quiet when she stepped in. She recognized a few faces from yesterday's all-hands meeting. They nodded politely and went back to their conversations about weekend plans and deployment schedules. Normal people problems.

Her office was on the fourth floor, with a view of the parking lot and a whiteboard covered in project timelines that changed weekly. She'd learned to write everything in erasable marker.

The first meeting was with her direct reports—five team leads managing thirty-seven engineers across six different products. They filed in with their laptops and coffee, looking like they'd rather be anywhere else.

"Morning, everyone," Sarah said, consulting her agenda. "Let's start with Taskly migration status."

Michael, her most senior lead, shifted in his seat. "We've got some concerns about the timeline."

"What kind of concerns?"

"The kind where we lose two weeks of productivity while everyone learns a system that does less than what we're currently using."

Sarah had been expecting this. Michael was good at his job, which made him dangerous during corporate initiatives. He actually cared about the work getting done.

"I understand the learning curve is steep," she said, "but the long-term benefits—"

"What long-term benefits?" asked Jennifer, who managed the mobile team. "I looked at the feature comparison. We're losing API access, bulk operations, and custom fields."

Sarah consulted her notes. "The Innovation Lab is working on feature parity. The API is their top priority."

"Working on it means it doesn't exist yet."

"They're confident it will be ready by the end of Q1."

Michael leaned forward. "Sarah, you know us. We're not trying to be difficult. But this system isn't ready for production use."

She looked around the table at five people she genuinely respected, who trusted her to protect them from corporate nonsense. They were right, and she knew it, and they knew she knew it.

"The decision has been made at the executive level," she said finally. "Our job is to make it work."

The meeting continued with status updates, resource requests, and the usual juggling of priorities. Sarah took notes on everything, knowing that half of it would change by next week when Vincent had his next "strategic insight".

After the team leads left, she had fifteen minutes to review the Innovation Lab's training materials before her next meeting. The user guide was twelve pages of screenshots with captions like "Click here to create a new project" and "Use this dropdown to select your team." It read like it had been written by someone who'd never actually managed a project.

Her phone buzzed with a text from Emma: "Mom, I need $20 for the field trip tomorrow. Can you Venmo me?"

Field trip. She'd signed the permission slip but forgotten about the payment. She opened Venmo and sent the money, adding a heart emoji.

The next meeting was with Lisa from the Innovation Lab. Lisa arrived with a laptop covered in startup stickers and the enthusiasm of someone who'd never had to support a system in production.

"Sarah! Thanks for making time. I wanted to get your thoughts on the rollout strategy."

Sarah had prepared for this conversation. "The teams are excited about the new capabilities," she said, which was technically true if you considered resignation a form of excitement.

"That's great to hear! We've been getting mixed feedback from some of the other departments."

"What kind of mixed feedback?"

Lisa opened her laptop and pulled up a spreadsheet. "Some concerns about performance, feature gaps, that sort of thing. But I think it's just resistance to change, you know?"

Sarah looked at the spreadsheet. User complaints organized by category: "Performance Issues" (47 entries), "Missing Features" (23 entries), "Data Migration Problems" (31 entries), "Training Gaps" (18 entries).

"This is quite a bit of feedback," Sarah said carefully.

"Oh, totally! But we're treating it as valuable user input. Every complaint is an opportunity to improve."

Sarah translated this as: we built something that doesn't work and we're hoping the users will tell us how to fix it.

"What's the timeline for addressing these issues?"

"We're prioritizing based on impact and effort. The high-impact, low-effort items should be resolved by end of quarter."

"And the high-impact, high-effort items?"

Lisa's enthusiasm dimmed slightly. "Those are more complex. We're looking at Q2 or Q3 for the major architectural changes."

Sarah made a note: "Feature requests indefinitely delayed." She'd need to manage her teams' expectations accordingly.

The conversation continued for another twenty minutes, with Lisa asking for Sarah's help in "change management" and "user adoption strategies." Sarah agreed to schedule training sessions, create communication plans, and serve as the liaison between her teams and the Innovation Lab.

By the time Lisa left, Sarah had volunteered for six additional responsibilities and committed to metrics she wasn't sure she could deliver.

Her calendar reminder popped up: "Lunch - Review Training Materials." She grabbed a salad from the cafeteria and ate at her desk while reading through the Taskly documentation. The more she read, the more she understood her teams' concerns. The system was ambitious but incomplete, like a house with beautiful blueprints but no foundation.

Her phone rang. Emma's school.

"Mrs. Mitchell? This is Principal Rodriguez. Emma's in the nurse's office with a headache. She's asking to go home."

Sarah looked at her calendar. The vendor meeting in twenty minutes, then the budget review, then the quarterly planning session.

"Is she running a fever?"

"No fever, but she says her stomach hurts too."

Sarah knew that combination. Emma was stressed about something—probably the math test she'd been worried about all week.

"I'll be there in thirty minutes," she said.

She sent quick messages to reschedule her next two meetings, grabbed her keys, and headed for the elevator. In the car, she called Mark.

"Em's sick. I'm picking her up from school."

"What about your meetings?"

"I moved them." She didn't mention that she'd moved them to 7 PM and 8 PM respectively, which meant she'd be working until 9:30.

Emma was waiting in the nurse's office, looking small and miserable. Sarah signed her out and they walked to the car in silence.

"Rough day?" Sarah asked as they pulled out of the parking lot.

"I forgot to study for the math test. And Jenna's being weird about the science project. And I think I'm getting a cold."

Sarah recognized the feeling. Too many things happening at once, none of them under your control.

"Want to get ice cream and talk about it?"

Emma nodded, and Sarah turned toward the Dairy Queen instead of home. Her phone was buzzing with meeting reminders and urgent emails, but for the next hour, she was just a mom helping her daughter figure out middle school politics and pre-algebra.

They sat in a corner booth with their Blizzards, and Emma explained the complex social dynamics of seventh grade while Sarah listened and offered advice that probably wouldn't work but might help Emma feel heard.

By the time they got home, it was 4:30. Sarah had missed the vendor call and had seventeen new emails. She helped Emma with her math homework at the kitchen table while responding to messages on her phone.

"Mom, you're not paying attention," Emma said.

Sarah looked up from her phone. Emma was right. She'd been nodding along while mentally composing responses to Vincent's latest strategic pivot.

"You're right. Sorry. Show me the problem again."

They worked through the algebra together, and Sarah remembered why she'd majored in business instead of engineering. Emma was better at math than she was, which made her both proud and terrified at the same time.

Mark got home at 6 with takeout Chinese food. They ate dinner as a family, talking about Emma's soccer season and Mark's new project at the architecture firm. Normal family stuff that felt like a luxury.

After dinner, Sarah retreated to her home office to catch up on the work she'd missed. The vendor call had been rescheduled to 8 PM. The budget review was now a phone call at 9 PM. The quarterly planning session was moved to tomorrow morning at 7 AM.

She opened her laptop and started working through her email backlog. Forty-three new messages since lunch. Two more "URGENT" flags from Vincent, three escalations from other departments, and a string of replies about Taskly issues that made her head hurt.

At 8 PM, she dialed into the vendor call from her kitchen table while Emma did her science homework nearby. The conversation was about software licenses and contract renewals—important but not urgent, despite the "URGENT" flag on the meeting invite.

At 9 PM, she took the budget review call from the living room while Mark watched the news. Vincent wanted to understand the ROI projections for the Taskly migration, which required her to create metrics that showed positive value for a system that was costing more in lost productivity than it saved in licensing fees.

She opened a spreadsheet and started building a model that would tell the story Vincent wanted to hear. Reduced vendor costs, improved efficiency metrics, enhanced collaboration capabilities. The numbers were technically accurate, even if they didn't reflect the reality her teams were experiencing.

By 10 PM, she'd finished the ROI analysis, responded to the day's urgent emails, and prepared for tomorrow's 7 AM meeting. Emma was in bed, Mark was asleep, and she was sitting at her kitchen table with her laptop, wondering when her job had become a performance where she pretended everything was working while knowing it wasn't.

She closed the laptop and checked on Emma, who was asleep with her math textbook still open beside her. Sarah closed the book and turned off the light.

In her own bedroom, she set her alarm for 5:45 AM and plugged in her phone. Tomorrow would bring new urgent emails, new strategic pivots, and new ways to make broken systems look successful.

She lay in bed thinking about the conversation with her team leads. They trusted her to protect them from corporate nonsense, but increasingly, her job was to deliver the corporate nonsense with a smile and call it strategy.

Her phone buzzed with one last email from Vincent: "Great work on the ROI analysis. Let's discuss scaling this approach to other internal tools. Can you prepare a presentation for the executive team?"

She turned the phone face down and closed her eyes.
