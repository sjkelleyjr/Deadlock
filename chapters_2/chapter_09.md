# Chapter 9

Mack's apartment was a shrine to unfinished projects. Three mechanical keyboards sat on his desk, each with different keycaps and switches. A Raspberry Pi cluster hummed quietly in the corner, running some cryptocurrency mining operation that had stopped being profitable six months ago. His walls were covered in whiteboards, each filled with diagrams and code snippets that had seemed brilliant at 2 AM but made no sense in daylight.

It was 11 PM on a Tuesday, and Mack was supposed to be working on a bug fix for the Taskly integration. Instead, he was building a script that would automatically generate "innovative" code comments based on the guidelines they'd developed for the code review process.

His girlfriend, Jasmine, was sitting on the couch behind him, scrolling through her phone. She worked in marketing at a different company and had stopped trying to understand what Mack did for a living about six months into their relationship.

"What are you working on?" she asked, not looking up from her phone.

"Just some automation stuff," Mack replied, typing furiously.

"Is it for work?"

"Sort of. It's for making work easier."

Jasmine put down her phone and walked over to his desk. She looked at the code on his screen, which was mostly comments about AI and machine learning algorithms.

"This looks like the same thing you were working on last week. The thing that was supposed to help with code reviews?"

"Same concept, different implementation. This version is more sophisticated."

"Didn't you say the last version was going to revolutionize how your team works?"

Mack paused his typing. "I might have oversold it a bit."

Jasmine laughed. "You always oversell it. Remember the cryptocurrency mining setup? You said it was going to make us rich."

"That was before the market crashed."

"And the smart home automation system that was going to control everything with voice commands?"

"It works for the lights. Mostly."

"And the productivity app that was going to change how people work?"

"I'm still working on that one."

Jasmine sat down on the edge of his desk. "You know what I think? I think you get excited about these projects because they're more interesting than your actual job."

Mack looked up from his screen. "My job is interesting. It's just... constrained."

"By what?"

"By corporate policies. By managers who don't understand technology. By processes that exist for no reason other than to justify someone's job."

Rachel nodded. "So you build these side projects to feel like you're actually creating something useful."

"Maybe. Or maybe I just like building things."

"Even if you never finish them?"

Mack turned back to his screen. "I finish some of them."

"Name one."

"The script that automatically generates meeting notes from calendar invites."

"That's the one that just creates a template with the meeting title and attendees, right?"

"It saves me five minutes every time I have a meeting."

Jasmine smiled. "Five minutes. That's your most successful project."

Mack didn't respond. He was focused on debugging the comment generation script, which was currently producing comments that made no sense even by corporate standards.

"Hey," Jasmine said, "do you want to go get dinner? We could try that new Thai place that opened up."

"In a minute. I just need to fix this bug."

Jasmine sighed and went back to the couch. She'd learned that "in a minute" meant "maybe in an hour, if I remember."

Mack's phone buzzed. It was a message from Alex: "Did you see the new Innovation Score requirements? They want us to include 'disruptive thinking' metrics now."

Mack typed back: "Define 'disruptive thinking.'"

"According to the 23-page document Vincent just sent, it means 'challenging conventional approaches to problem-solving while maintaining alignment with strategic objectives.' Also, he mentioned something about 'vibe coding' being the future of software development."

"So we're supposed to be disruptive but not too disruptive?"

"Exactly. The sweet spot is 'innovative disruption that doesn't actually change anything.'"

Mack laughed and went back to his script. He was trying to add a feature that would analyze the actual code and suggest appropriate buzzwords based on the function's complexity. The problem was that the script kept suggesting "blockchain" for simple string manipulation functions.

His roommate, Carlos, walked in from his room. Carlos was also a developer, but at a startup that was actually doing interesting work.

"What are you building now?" Carlos asked, looking over Mack's shoulder.

"Comment generator for corporate code reviews."

"Let me guess—it adds buzzwords to make simple functions sound innovative?"

"Exactly. Want to see it in action?"

Carlos pulled up a chair. "Hit me."

Mack ran the script on a simple function that calculated the average of an array:

```javascript
function calculateAverage(numbers) {
    return numbers.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0) / numbers.length;
}
```

The script generated:

```javascript
// REVOLUTIONARY AI-POWERED STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ENGINE
// This cutting-edge algorithm leverages machine learning
// to perform advanced mathematical computations through
// neural network pattern recognition and predictive analytics

function calculateAverage(numbers) {
    // INNOVATION SCORE: 8.9/10
    // Disruptive approach to statistical computation
    // combining traditional mathematics with quantum computing principles
    
    return numbers.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0) / numbers.length;
}
```

Carlos stared at the output for a moment. "That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen."

"Isn't it beautiful?"

"It's like you're writing satire."

Mack grinned. "That's the beauty of it. The more absurd the comments, the more likely management is to approve the code."

"Your company actually falls for this?"

"Not just falls for it—they love it. Vincent thinks we're building the most innovative codebase in the industry."

Carlos shook his head. "I'm glad I work at a startup. At least we can just write code that works."

"Don't get me wrong, I'd love to work somewhere where I could just focus on building good software. But until then, I'm going to make the best of what I've got."

Jasmine called from the couch. "Are you two going to talk about work all night?"

"Sorry," Mack said. "We're almost done."

Carlos stood up. "I should get back to my project anyway. We're launching a new feature next week."

"What kind of feature?" Mack asked.

"Real-time collaboration tools. The kind of thing that actually helps people work together."

Mack felt a pang of envy. Carlos got to build things that mattered, while he was stuck gaming a system that didn't make sense.

After Carlos left, Mack went back to his script. He was trying to add a feature that would automatically adjust the Innovation Score based on the reviewer. Vincent always gave higher scores for mentions of AI and blockchain. Sarah preferred references to "synergy" and "collaboration." Michael responded well to anything that mentioned "efficiency" and "productivity."

Jasmine came over and put her hands on his shoulders. "You're tense."

"I'm fine."

"You're not fine. You're frustrated because you want to build something meaningful, but you're stuck playing corporate games."

Mack leaned back in his chair. "It's not that simple."

"Isn't it? You're clearly talented. You could work anywhere. Why stay at a place that makes you build fake innovation instead of real solutions?"

"Because it's not that easy to just quit and find something better. Because I have bills to pay. Because maybe I'm not as good as I think I am."

Jasmine sat down in Carlos's chair. "That's bullshit and you know it. You're brilliant. You just need to find a place that appreciates that."

"Easy for you to say. You work in marketing. You get to be creative and work with people who understand what you do."

"Marketing has its own corporate bullshit. Trust me. But at least I'm not pretending to be innovative when I'm just doing my job."

Mack looked at his screen. The script was working perfectly, generating comments that would make any corporate manager happy. It was a masterpiece of absurdity, a perfect reflection of the system he was trying to survive.

"You know what the worst part is?" he said. "I'm actually proud of this script. It's clever. It's well-written. It solves a real problem. But the problem it solves shouldn't exist."

Jasmine nodded. "So why not build something that solves a real problem instead?"

"Like what?"

"I don't know. Something that actually helps people. Something that makes the world better instead of just making corporate managers happy."

Mack thought about it. He had dozens of half-finished projects that had started with good intentions. A privacy-respecting social media alternative. A tool for helping people learn to code. A system for connecting local businesses with customers. All abandoned when they got too complex or when he got bored.

"Maybe you're right," he said. "Maybe I should focus on building something that matters."

"Or maybe you should just finish one of the projects you've already started."

Mack looked around his apartment at the evidence of his scattered creativity. "Which one?"

"The productivity app. The one that was supposed to help people work better. That seems like something you actually care about."

Mack opened the folder for his productivity app. It was a mess of half-implemented features and abandoned ideas. But there was something there, a core concept that had seemed important when he'd started it.

"You know what? You're right. Let me show you what I was trying to build."

He opened the main file and started explaining the concept. It was a tool that would help people focus on what mattered by automatically identifying and eliminating distractions. Not the corporate version of productivity that meant more meetings and more metrics, but real productivity that meant getting important work done.

As he talked, Rachel listened. Really listened. And for the first time in months, Mack felt like someone understood what he was trying to accomplish.

"See, the problem with most productivity tools is that they're designed by people who think productivity means doing more things faster," he said. "But real productivity is about doing the right things well."

"That's actually really insightful," Rachel said.

"It's simple, but nobody seems to get it. They keep building tools that make you track every minute of your day instead of tools that help you focus on what's important."

"So why don't you finish it?"

Mack looked at the code. "It's complicated. There are a lot of moving parts."

"Start with one part. Make it work. Then add the next part."

"That's not how I usually work."

"Maybe that's the problem. You try to build everything at once instead of building one thing well."

Mack thought about it. She was right. He always got excited about the big picture and tried to implement everything at once. Then when it got overwhelming, he'd abandon it and start something new.

"Okay," he said. "Let's start with the core feature. The distraction identification."

He opened a new file and started coding. Not the corporate code with fake innovation comments, but real code that solved a real problem. It felt good.

Rachel watched him work for a while, then went to the kitchen to make coffee. When she came back, Mack was still typing, but now he was smiling.

"What are you working on?" she asked.

"The core algorithm. It's actually coming together."

"See? When you focus on something that matters, you can do amazing things."

Mack looked up from his screen. "Thanks"

"Anytime. Now, about that Thai food..."

"Give me another hour. I want to get this working."
