# Chapter 16

The email arrived at 6:12 AM with a subject line that tried to sound calm: Organizational Update — Strengthening Focus. By 8:00, the floor was reading the same paragraphs with different names.

Sarah printed hers and circled nothing. Michael read his on his phone in the parking lot, then put the phone away and sat in the car for another 5 minutes. Alex, Mack, and Jordan skimmed theirs at their desks and arrived at the same conclusion by different routes.

“Reorg,” Mack said, not looking up. “Today.”

“Effective immediately,” Jordan added.

Alex closed the tab. “Of course it is.”

The all-hands was scheduled for 9:00 and started at 9:17. Vincent stepped onto the small platform at the front of the cafeteria and spoke like change was a product launch.

“We’re realigning to accelerate outcomes,” he said. “This will allow us to sharpen execution, reduce silos, and move faster on strategic priorities.”

The slide behind him listed three pillars and a handful of verbs that could be rearranged without changing meaning. A diagram showed boxes moving into other boxes.

“Effective today,” Vincent continued, “we’re forming three cross-functional initiative teams: Growth, Reliability, and Experience. Each will have dedicated leadership, clear charters, and accountability for outcomes.”

He paused for the cadence he used instead of punctuation. “Michael will lead Reliability as Senior Engineering Manager.”

Sarah clapped before anyone else did. Michael nodded once, a small acknowledgment; the new title came without his team.

“As part of this,” Vincent said, “we’re sunsetting legacy squads and reassigning individual contributors to maximize impact. Change can be uncomfortable, but it’s necessary.”

He didn’t read the list of names. HR would do that later, one meeting at a time.

By 10:30, calendars repopulated like a time-lapse of mold. Alex received an invite titled Experience Intake — Sprint Zero. Jordan got Growth GTM Enablement. Mack got Reliability Tooling — Migration Plan (Draft).

Sarah’s one-on-ones turned into transition calls. Her team had been pulled apart and distributed like spare parts between the three initiatives. She had a new title—Director, Platform Programs—and no direct reports.

Michael had a team without his team in it. Reliability came with a charter, a roadmap, and six positions that were “to be filled.” It also came with an inbox full of questions about ownership that no one had answered because the ownership had just moved.

He walked to where his team had always sat and found three empty chairs and a pile of cables labeled for recycling. He stood there longer than the moment required and then kept moving.

Alex’s new manager introduced himself over video with a background that looked like a rental. “Welcome to Experience,” he said. “We’re going to make the product feel delightful.”

He assigned her a task labeled Journey Map Instrumentation and attached a design doc that treated user clicks like wishes. The acceptance criteria required three dashboards and a weekly sentiment report.

Alex opened the code and found nothing to change yet. She added a note to herself: define delight.

Her last PR pinged her just to close itself: “team no longer owns this component.” Her repo access disappeared for four hours.

—

Mack’s Reliability invite came with a spreadsheet and a directive: migrate all services to the new observability platform by end of quarter. The spreadsheet listed every service by name and included a column for “owner” that was blank for a third of them.

He posted in the new reliability intake channel. “Is this ours?”

His manager replied in-thread: “It is now.”

Mack wrote a small probe to scan service registries and fill in the blanks. The probe returned two hundred names and four ghosts.

—

Jordan’s Growth kickoff was a loop of acronyms. GTM, NPS, LTV. He was asked to “bridge product and narrative” and “socialize wins.” He suggested starting with which wins existed. No one answered; a slide advanced.

Afterward, he got a DM from a product director he’d never met: “Great energy. Could you own the weekly Growth Standup?” He typed “Happy to help” and watched as the invite appeared on his calendar, daily.

—

At noon, Sarah found Michael in a conference room that still had their old team’s sprint board on the wall. He was erasing it line by line, preserving nothing.

“Congratulations,” she said.

“I lost everyone,” he said.

“You gained a mandate,” she said.

“And a hiring freeze.”

They looked at the empty columns on the board. To Do. Doing. Done. The markers left faint ghosts where names used to be.

“They’ll come to you for answers,” Sarah said. “Even if you don’t have any yet.”

“I’ll make some,” Michael said. It was half promise, half reflex.

—

The first week of the new shape felt like wearing someone else’s jacket. It fit if you didn’t move too much.

Alex joined a workshop about microcopy guidelines for the onboarding flow. A facilitator asked the group to brainstorm three adjectives that described their brand voice. Alex wrote “accurate,” “fast,” and left the third blank.

“We like ‘playful,’” the facilitator said. “Can we be playful?”

“Not in error messages,” Alex said.

She was assigned to implement a tooltip that explained a page that shouldn’t need a tooltip. She wrote the tooltip and the bug report that would replace the page later.

—

Mack started wiring collectors into services that hadn’t been touched in a year. He built guardrails so the agent wouldn’t talk to places it shouldn’t, and he wrote a stern README for a service that turned out to be a job no one owned that restarted at midnight for reasons that were lost.

The platform vendor offered “white-glove migration.” He watched one glove wave from a video window and kept his hands on the keyboard.

At 2:10 AM a pager woke him; prod needed a hotfix he couldn’t ship because roles had moved. He typed “need temp elevate” and watched the spinner while he yawned.

—

Jordan facilitated Growth Standup #3 of 5 for the week and learned that “growth” meant different things to different departments and everything to no one. Marketing wanted case studies; Sales wanted features; Product wanted “momentum.” He took notes in verbs and assigned follow-ups that would keep people busy.

He added a private line in his doc: growth of what?

His calendar stacked three 8:15 standups on top of each other. He joined the wrong one and cheerfully updated a room that wasn’t his.

—

Michael’s Reliability charter wanted SLOs for systems that had never been instrumented. He drafted targets that were honest: “unknown” for baseline, “TBD” for alerting. He wrote a document titled What We Can Promise Right Now and sent it to Vincent, who replied with a thumbs-up and “Can we make it 99.99?”

Michael did not reply.

He found himself answering questions from people who used to be his team and people who now thought he was their manager. He drew a map of ownership on the whiteboard and then erased it when it changed again in the afternoon.

—

Sarah’s calendar filled with cross-initiative syncs that synchronized nothing. She tried to spot the pattern in the new org chart, then stopped trying. She wrote a list titled Things That Still Exist and added five items.

She walked past the desks where her team used to sit and didn’t linger. A box of old lanyards sat on the corner of a cabinet with a sign that said FREE.

Overnight, the old team channel had been archived; pinned runbooks 404’d; even the inside jokes were gone.

—

By Friday, the edges of the new shape had hardened. Alex had a second tooltip to write and a meeting about “gamifying adoption.” Mack had a migration spreadsheet that now had owners and red cells where the agent refused to install. Jordan had a weekly email titled Growth Wins that contained three bullet points and two caveats.

Michael had a plan that would work if he had three more people, and a list of risks that read like a budget request.

He sent Sarah a one-line message: “If we get through this quarter, it will be because of duct tape.”

She replied: “Call it ‘reliability tape’ and finance will fund it.”

—

At 5:40, Alex wrote a commit message that said the tooltip now told the truth. Mack merged a collector wrapper that prevented an infinite loop from calling home until the heat death of the universe. Jordan moved his Growth Standup to 8:20 to avoid stepping on three other standups that had been moved to 8:15.

Michael looked at the Reliability charter and crossed out two goals that did not belong to him anymore. He added one he could keep: “Reduce surprises.”

He closed the document and opened his calendar. Monday had rearranged itself while he was working. He dragged a block titled Reliability Triage to the morning and left the description empty.

The office lights flickered once and stayed on. The new shape held. For now.
