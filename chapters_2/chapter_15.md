# Chapter 15

David scheduled the meeting for 7:35 AM because the calendar would let him. The subject line read: “Informational Review — Productivity Signals.” He avoided the word investigation like it was a policy violation.

Sarah arrived first, carrying a folder that made her look prepared. Alex, Mack, and Jordan followed, each with a different idea of what the meeting might be about and the same certainty that it wouldn’t help them ship anything.

David sat at the head of the small room with a spiral-bound notebook and a pen that clicked softly when he thought. “Thanks for making time. I want to understand some recent patterns so we can support you better.”

Jordan took the middle chair. “What patterns are we talking about?”

David slid a printed report across the table. The header said Workforce Analytics in a font that looked confident. The charts suggested that someone had been paying attention to everything except the work.

"We’ve seen irregularities in activity metrics," David said. "Meeting attendance has dipped on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Keyboard telemetry is inconsistent. Time logged in the new system doesn’t map to expected story flow."

Mack blinked. “Keyboard telemetry?”

“We implemented a lightweight engagement tool,” David said. “It helps us identify burnout early.”

Alex looked at the chart that represented a week of her life as a heatmap. “Or it helps you measure the number of times someone bumps a key while thinking.”

“It’s not punitive,” David said quickly. “We’re trying to be proactive.”

Sarah spoke before the room decided what to feel. “We value well-being, but we can’t equate activity with output. The last two outages were resolved by people who weren’t in meetings.”

David nodded and wrote that down as if the system might incorporate nuance if he gave it enough examples. “Completely agree. Still, leadership has asked me to look for trends that could indicate systemic issues.”

“What counts as a trend?” Jordan asked.

David turned a page. “Clusters of irregular signals. For example, the week we announced the code review rubric change, engagement dropped on Wednesdays.”

“Because we were fixing the security audit findings,” Alex said.

“The tool doesn’t know that,” David said. “It only knows what it knows.”

Mack leaned back. “And now it knows we’re irregular on Wednesdays.”

David clicked his pen again. “I’m not here to assign blame. I’m here to ensure alignment between our processes and your realities.”

Sarah folded her hands. “What do you need from us?”

“Clarity,” David said. “And cooperation with some monitoring changes. Leadership wants signal that our transformation is, in fact, transforming.”

Jordan kept his voice even. “What kind of changes?”

“Refined attendance expectations,” David said. “Meeting confirmations with reason codes. Weekly activity summaries auto-generated by the system for your review. And a trial of screen focus prompts that remind users to re-engage after a period of inactivity.”

Mack stared at him. “You want my laptop to ask me if I’m paying attention.”

“Gentle prompts,” David said. “Configurable.”

Alex watched Sarah’s jaw set. “We’ll need to see the privacy policy.”

David brightened. “We have one. Legal helped draft it.”

The prompts arrived by lunch. A translucent banner slid across Alex’s screen: Are you still focused on sanctioned work? Click yes to acknowledge. She did not click yes. She committed code instead and the banner faded on its own, satisfied that something had happened.

Mack collected screenshots. He had a folder named museum where he stored artifacts of corporate life: launch emails, training slides, a memo that congratulated the team for completing a mandatory training that didn’t exist. The new prompts fit right in.

Jordan drafted an FAQ for the team. He kept the tone neutral and the verbs careful: what’s collected, what isn’t, what to do when the system asks a question it can’t understand. He added a line that said, “We are not our telemetry.”

Sarah forwarded leadership’s note that said the prompts were “a light-touch nudge toward engagement, not surveillance,” and asked managers to “model compliance.” She scheduled a meeting to ask why the nudge required admin privileges.

David sent a calendar invite titled Alignment Touchpoint. No one accepted. The system marked them tentative and felt included.

—

By midweek, the changes had rippled. Meeting invites included a new dropdown labeled Purpose with options like Decision, Status, Ideation, and Culture. If you chose Culture, the invite required a facilitator and a post-session artifact.

“What’s a culture artifact?” Mack asked.

“A photo of people smiling,” Jordan said.

Alex tried to select Other and the field turned red and refused it. She selected Decision and attached a one-line agenda that was the only decision that would be made.

The attendance system began rejecting meetings that overlapped by more than ten percent. Vincent’s triple-booked hour rendered itself into a puzzle that the scheduling assistant could not solve. He showed up late to the one with the most executive names and declared the new system a breakthrough.

—

David walked the floor with his notebook and his careful nod. He asked open-ended questions that sounded like policy. “How are you experiencing the prompts?” “Do you feel the attendance tags reflect reality?” “What support would make engagement more intuitive?”

Alex answered with specifics. “The prompt interrupts full-screen terminals. The meeting reasons are imprecise. The system mistakes code reviews for idle time.”

David wrote it all down. “This is helpful.”

Mack asked for the prompt source. David promised to check. He returned with a link that required a role no one had.

Jordan suggested a compromise: batch prompts to avoid interrupting typing; exempt terminals and video calls; limit reason codes to three that meant something. David nodded and asked him to help draft the changes. Jordan said yes before he could stop himself.

Leadership wanted a readout by Friday. David stayed late on Thursday, assembling a narrative that would please people who needed graphs with arrows. He balanced phrases like “early indicators” and “encouraging alignment” with “opportunities for calibration.” He pasted three screenshots of dashboards that looked official.

He added a section titled Risk. It felt dangerous to include and more dangerous to omit. He wrote: “Over-instrumentation risks conflating activity with output. Signals without context may mislead.” He deleted the second sentence and then put it back.

He sent the draft to Sarah for review. She removed half the adjectives and the sentence that said the team was “leaning into transformation,” then added a line: “Engineering output has remained steady during this period.” She did not add a graph.

—

Friday’s readout was a room of managers nodding at verbs. Vincent asked if the numbers could be rolled up into a single score. David said they could. Legal asked if the privacy notice should be updated. David said it would be. Finance asked what the ROI of prompts was. No one answered.

When it ended, Sarah closed her laptop and caught David in the hallway. “Is this going to help?”

David’s face did not have a setting for certainty. “It might prevent a memo.”

“From whom?”

“The kind that starts with ‘Effective immediately.’”

Sarah sighed. “Keep it from turning into punishment.”

“I’m trying,” David said.

—

The system adapted by Monday. Prompts appeared less often. The dropdown lost three options and gained a checkbox that said No artifact will be created. The attendance tool recognized code reviews as time spent thinking with hands. Someone had taught it manners.

Jordan’s FAQ grew to include edge cases and a line that said “You can say no.” He used it twice on Tuesday, once on behalf of someone else.

Mack added a rule to his window manager that automatically moved prompts to a corner of the second monitor, where they expired peacefully.

Alex wrote a tiny daemon that pressed yes when a build finished.

—

At the end of the week, David sent a thank-you note to the team: “Appreciate your partnership as we calibrate.” He meant it.

He archived his notes, labeled the folder Alignment — Q3, and opened a new one titled Signals — Open Questions.

He wrote: “What are we measuring?” Then he clicked save and went to his next meeting, where a dashboard indicated that everything was fine as long as you didn’t ask why.
