# Chapter 17

The invite said Innovation Workshop and blocked three hours. Optional was in the description in a way that meant mandatory.

The room had been reset overnight: round tables, sticky note stacks in six colors, markers that squeaked, and a banner that read Think Like A Founder.

Vincent stood by a whiteboard with a list of rules that all said the same thing differently: no idea is a bad idea, defer judgment, build on others’ ideas, dream big, move fast.

“We’re here to unlock disruptive thinking,” he said. “Let’s get outside our comfort zones.”

Alex sat at a table with Mack, Jordan, and three people from marketing who had been told they were technical because they used Excel functions. Sarah hovered near the door, half host, half bouncer.

The facilitator—someone from Learning & Development with a cheerful lanyard—handed out prompt cards. “Round one: 50 ideas in 15 minutes. Quantity over quality.” She clicked a timer that started counting down from 14:59 in large, encouraging numbers.

They started writing because the room had decided to write.

Alex wrote: less friction in deployment, a real staging environment, smaller pull requests, delete the feature that no one uses, replace cron jobs that drift, fewer dashboards with more truth, a feedback form that routes to someone who can fix the thing, a bug bash without prizes.

Mack wrote: dark mode for the admin console, a deploy button shaped like a big red button, a feature flag that triggers confetti in Slack, a system that laughs when a build passes, an API that speaks sarcasm, bring-your-dog-to-work day, a pager that pages the person who approved the risky change.

Jordan wrote: quarterly customer councils, vendor contract leverage points, a win-back plan for churned accounts, an executive narrative that didn’t sound like a spreadsheet, conversations with support reps that weren’t recorded.

The marketing people wrote: viral growth loops, influencer partnerships, a TikTok strategy for developer tools, a manifesto.

The facilitator yelled “Pens down!” like it was a game show and taped everyone's sticky notes to the wall in clusters that meant something if you stood far enough away.

“Now dot vote,” she said, handing out colored stickers. “Vote with your heart.”

The stickers gravitated toward Mack’s jokes and the marketing loops. Alex’s notes formed a quiet island that looked like work.

Vincent walked the wall nodding at bolder colors. “This is the energy we need.” He stood in front of Mack’s “pager that pages the approver” and laughed. “Accountability—love it. Make it playful.”

“Playful?” Alex said.

“Gamified accountability,” Vincent said, as if that explained anything.

Sarah’s expression did a small calculation and returned zero.

Round two was “build on the winners.” The facilitator split the room into teams and assigned a “concept owner” to each cluster. Jordan was given “customer councils.” Mack got “playful accountability.” Alex got “reduce deployment friction,” which was promptly renamed “speed to delight.”

“Let’s craft a vision,” the facilitator said, flipping to a slide with a template: For [users], who [need], our [solution] provides [benefit] unlike [alternative], because [magic].

Alex filled the brackets with nouns that existed. The marketer next to her filled them with adjectives. By the time the timer beeped, the sentence could be read aloud in a meeting without meaning.

Mack had built a game mechanic on a napkin: points for fixing your own breakages, multipliers for catching issues before deploy, a leaderboard with seasonal resets, a “we found it first” badge that automatically included legal.

“We’ll call it Ship Quest,” he said.

“That’s… actually coherent,” Sarah said, which was her version of a compliment.

Jordan had sketched a council structure with a cadence, agenda skeletons, and a promise that someone would actually do something with the feedback. It was boring and therefore valuable.

The facilitator called time and handed each table a foam microphone. “Pitch time. Two minutes. Make us believe.”

Mack went first. He sold Ship Quest like it was a late-night infomercial for accountability. The room laughed in the right places. Vincent clapped.

Jordan went next. He described the customer councils with practiced calm. Vincent nodded, then asked if it could be rebranded “Innovation Ambassadors.” Jordan said yes because saying no would assign him six more hours of follow up meetings.

Alex stood last and pitched the idea of deploying without ritual pain. She said smaller changes shipped safer; fewer approvals moved faster; pre-merge checks caught more than post-mortems. She described removing a meeting and adding a test. She didn’t say delight.

Vincent smiled. “Love the spirit. But where’s the disruption?”

“Shipping working software on purpose,” Alex said.

The facilitator moved on before anyone had to decide whether that counted.

“Final round,” she said. “Assign owners for pilots.”

Sarah opened her mouth to say something about capacity and was thanked for her leadership. “This is where managers clear the path,” the facilitator said.

Vincent pointed like he was dealing cards. “Mack, own Ship Quest. Jordan, run Innovation Ambassadors. Alex, lead Speed to Delight.”

Alex glanced at Sarah, who looked like she’d been handed a crate of live birds.

“We’ll need guardrails,” Sarah said carefully. “And definitions.”

“We’ll iterate,” Vincent said. “We’re agile.”

The afternoon turned into logistics. Mack spun up a prototype that awarded points for writing a failing test before a fix and docked points for merging after 5 PM on Fridays. He added a rule that prevented anyone from transferring points to their manager.

Jordan put together a list of ten customers who might actually want to talk and wrote an email that sounded like a human. Two replied yes, four asked what it was, and one asked if this meant pricing was changing.

Alex drafted a change to the deployment policy that removed one approval and replaced it with a required integration test. She wrote three paragraphs without adjectives and sent them to Michael for a sanity check.

Michael replied from a meeting: “Bullseye. Expect turbulence.”

“Turbulence” arrived as a calendar invite titled Speed to Delight Pilot—Gate Review. Attendees: four managers, one architect, Legal, Risk, “Brand.”

Brand asked whether removing an approval would harm delight. Legal asked whether smaller changes could be sued. Risk asked for a rollback plan for the rollback plan. The architect asked why the integration test didn’t test everything.

Alex kept her answers unambiguous and short. “No.” “No.” “Here.” “Because that’s impossible.”

When it ended, Sarah caught her in the doorway. “You were clear,” she said. “Clarity doesn’t always win.”

“Does it ever?”

“Sometimes it just keeps a worse idea from getting approved.”

—

Mack’s Ship Quest prototype leaked into Slack and collected emoji like lint. Someone asked if points could be redeemed for not being on call. Someone else asked if losing points meant you had to present at the post-mortem. The leaderboard showed a product manager in first place for suggesting that a feature be deleted.

"We need guardrails," Sarah said.

"Done," Mack said. He added a config that disabled public leaderboards and sent only private weekly summaries. The seasonal reset stayed.

Vincent DM’d him: "Love the buzz. Can we roll it out company‑wide?"

Mack sent a thumbs‑up and muted the thread.

—

By the end of the week, the innovation workshop had produced a prototype game, a calendar, and a draft policy. Vincent declared it momentum in a company-wide note that used the word disruption three times.

The banner that said Think Like A Founder was folded and placed in a storage room with banners for three other initiatives that no one remembered starting.

A calendar hold appeared without an organizer and refused to move.
