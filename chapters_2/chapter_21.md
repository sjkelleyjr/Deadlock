# Chapter 21

Vincent's calendar invite blocked out four hours and included a deck titled "Q3 Transformation Wins - Executive Summary." The attachment was seventeen slides of metrics that looked impressive if you didn't understand what they measured.

Alex opened the deck and stared at the charts. Ship Quest had become "Gamified Accountability Framework." The customer councils were now "Innovation Ambassador Network." Her deployment policy changes were "Speed to Delight Initiative."

"They turned our work into slideware," she said.

Mack looked over her shoulder. "Slide twelve says we 'revolutionized cross-functional collaboration through data-driven engagement protocols.'"

"What does that even mean?" Jordan asked.

"It means Vincent needs to show the board we're innovative," Alex said. "And we're the evidence."

The conference room felt smaller with the full Innovation Council assembled. Sarah sat beside Vincent, who stood next to a wall-mounted display showing a timeline that ended with "Board Review - 72 Hours."

"The board wants to see transformation in action," Vincent said. "We're going to give them a live demonstration of our innovation initiatives."

Alex felt something cold settle in her stomach. "What kind of demonstration?"

"Real-time metrics," Vincent said. "Live deployment using Speed to Delight. Ship Quest leaderboard updates. Customer feedback from the Innovation Ambassadors. Everything we've built, working together."

Jordan kept his voice reserved. "That's a lot of moving parts for a live demo."

"Which is why we're implementing enhanced monitoring," Sarah said. "Full visibility into team activities, deployment timing, collaboration metrics. We need to ensure everything performs flawlessly."

David nodded from his corner. "I've prepared tracking dashboards for all team interactions. Meeting attendance, code review timing, deployment frequency, even Slack response rates."

Alex looked at the timeline again. Seventy-two hours. "What if something breaks during the demo?"

Vincent smiled. "That's why we hire the best engineers. Nothing will break."

The meeting dissolved into logistics. Vincent assigned Sarah to coordinate the monitoring rollout. David would track "engagement metrics" in real-time. The Innovation Council would prepare talking points about each initiative.

After everyone left, Alex, Mack, and Jordan sat in the empty conference room staring at the timeline on the wall.

"They're going to watch everything we do," Mack said.

"For seventy-two hours," Jordan added.

Alex opened her laptop and started typing. "We need to talk to Michael."

Michael's office felt smaller with four people in it. Alex closed the door and turned to face him.

"We have a problem," she said. "Vincent wants to turn our work into a live demo for the board. Sarah's implementing tracking on everything we do. We have seventy-two hours."

Michael leaned back in his chair. "What kind of tracking?"

"Everything," Jordan said. "Meeting attendance, code review timing, deployment frequency, Slack response rates. David called it 'engagement metrics.'"

"And if the demo goes wrong?" Michael asked.

"Vincent said nothing will break because we're the best engineers," Alex said. "Which means if something does break, it's our fault."

Michael was quiet for a moment. "What are you asking me to do?"

"We need to know if you're going to support us or throw us under the bus when this goes sideways," Mack said.

Michael looked at each of them. "You think it's going to go sideways?"

"It's a live demo of systems that were never designed to work together, performed in front of people who don't understand what they're looking at, with metrics that measure activity instead of outcomes," Alex said. "Of course it's going to go sideways."

"So what do you want to do?" Michael asked.

Alex looked at Jordan and Mack. They had reached the point where their individual survival strategies weren't enough. The game had changed, and continuing to play by the old rules would end them.

"We want to stop playing their game," she said.

Michael was quiet for a long time. Then he nodded. "What do you need from me?"

"Cover," Jordan said. "When we make our move, we need you to have our backs."

Michael looked at the timeline on his calendar. Seventy-two hours until the board review. Seventy-two hours to decide whether to keep playing along or take a stand.

"Okay," he said. "But we do this smart. No dramatic gestures. We present facts, we propose solutions, and we let the evidence speak for itself."

Alex smiled for the first time all day. "We can do that."

As they left Michael's office, Alex felt something she hadn't felt in months. Not optimism exactly, but something close to it. For the first time since she'd started at ByteSauce, she wasn't planning to survive the system.

She was planning to change it.

The timer on Vincent's timeline continued counting down. Seventy-one hours and fifty-three minutes until the board review.

The game was about to change.
