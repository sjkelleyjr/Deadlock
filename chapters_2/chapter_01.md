# Chapter 1: The All-Hands Meeting & Taskly Migration

The conference room was already packed when Alex walked in, laptop under one arm, coffee in the other hand. She scanned the room and spotted two empty seats near the back corner—her preferred territory for corporate spectacles. The projector displayed ByteSauce's new logo, a minimalist "B" that had cost more than most people's annual salary.

Vincent stood at the front, adjusting his wireless mic with the confidence of someone who'd never doubted his own importance. His Tesla key fob sat prominently on the table next to his MacBook Pro, positioned just so everyone could see the logo.

"Good morning, team!" Vincent's voice boomed through the speakers. "Today marks the beginning of our Digital Transformation Initiative 2.0."

Alex settled into her seat and opened her laptop. She'd learned to take notes during these meetings—not because the information was valuable, but because it was important to look busy so you weren't called on directly.

Two rows ahead, Mack was already typing something on his phone, probably live-tweeting the meeting to his private account. His mechanical keyboard sat unused on the table—even he wouldn't subject the room to Cherry MX Blues during an all-hands.

Jordan had claimed a seat in the middle section where he could see everyone's reactions. He had his notebook open, pen ready, looking like he was genuinely interested in whatever corporate theater was about to unfold.

"As you know," Vincent continued, clicking to his first slide, "we've been on an incredible journey of innovation and growth. But today, we're taking it to the next level."

The slide read: "DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE 2.0: SYNERGIZING PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS."

Alex typed: "Slide 1: 37 buzzwords, 0 concrete information."

"Our first major initiative," Vincent said, "is migrating all project management to our new internal platform: Taskly."

A murmur went through the room. Alex looked up from her laptop. Internal platform? Since when did ByteSauce build project management tools?

Sarah Mitchell stepped forward, her leather portfolio perfectly organized, her expression radiating the confidence of someone who'd spent the weekend preparing PowerPoint slides.

"Taskly represents everything we value at ByteSauce," Sarah announced. "Transparency, efficiency, and data-driven decision making. Built by our own Innovation Lab, it's designed specifically for our unique workflow needs."

Alex's fingers found her keyboard again: "Built by ByteSauce = 18 months of development hell, guaranteed."

"The migration timeline is aggressive but achievable," Sarah continued. "All teams will complete their transition by end of business Friday. That's four days to move your entire project history, retrain your workflows, and optimize your productivity metrics."

Mack's hand shot up. "What about the projects that are currently in flight? We've got deployments scheduled, client deliverables—"

"Great question, Marcus," Sarah said, consulting her notes. "The beauty of Taskly is its seamless integration capabilities. All existing work will transfer automatically through our migration tools."

Alex glanced at Mack, who was now staring at Sarah with the expression of someone who'd just been told that gravity was optional.

Jordan raised his hand with a diplomatic smile. "Sarah, this sounds like an exciting opportunity. Could you walk us through the training resources and support structure for the transition?"

"Absolutely, Jordan. We have comprehensive documentation, video tutorials, and our Innovation Lab team will be available for consultations throughout the process."

Vincent nodded approvingly. "This is exactly the kind of proactive thinking that makes ByteSauce special. We're not just using tools—we're building them."

Alex typed: "We're not buying proven solutions—we're reinventing the wheel at enterprise scale."

"Now," Vincent clicked to the next slide, "let's talk about the metrics that will help us measure success."

The slide was a rainbow of charts and graphs: "Velocity Optimization," "Throughput Enhancement," "Story Point Maximization," "Sprint Efficiency Coefficients."

"These KPIs will give us unprecedented visibility into our productivity patterns," Sarah explained. "Taskly automatically generates these reports, so there's no additional overhead for the teams."

Mack leaned back in his chair. Alex could see him calculating something in his head—probably how many hours of actual work they'd lose to feeding the metrics machine.

"The system also includes built-in time tracking," Sarah continued, "so we can correlate effort with output and identify optimization opportunities."

Alex's typing intensified: "Time tracking = surveillance with a productivity dashboard."

Jordan was taking careful notes, occasionally nodding. He'd probably already figured out how to make this work for his team while keeping everyone happy.

"Are there any questions about the transition process?" Vincent asked, scanning the room with the confidence of someone who'd never encountered a technical problem he couldn't solve with enthusiasm.

Alex looked around. The room was full of engineers who'd spent years learning the current system, building workflows, creating integrations. Now they were being told to throw it all away for something built by the Innovation Lab—a team that had never shipped a product to actual users.

"What about API compatibility?" asked someone from the backend team. "We've got automated deployments tied to the current system."

Sarah consulted her notes again. "Taskly includes a robust API with extensive documentation. The Innovation Lab has designed it to be even more flexible than what we're currently using."

Alex typed: "Translation: the API doesn't exist yet, but they're confident it will be great."

"Any other questions?" Vincent looked around the room. "No? Excellent. I love the energy in here. This is what innovation looks like."

The meeting began to wind down with the usual corporate closing rituals: action items, follow-ups, and reminders about "change management best practices."

As people started filing out, Alex caught up with Mack and Jordan near the door.

"So," Mack said quietly, "anyone want to bet on how long before the migration tools crash?"

"I'm more interested in what happens when we find out the Innovation Lab never actually used their own system for anything real," Alex replied.

Jordan was still looking at his notes. "The timeline is aggressive, but if we approach this strategically, we might be able to minimize the disruption."

Alex and Mack exchanged a look. Jordan's optimism was either admirable or delusional—they hadn't decided which.

"Come on," Jordan said, noticing their expressions. "It can't be worse than the last three system migrations we've survived."

"Famous last words," Mack muttered.

Alex was already pulling up the Innovation Lab's GitHub repository on her phone. If they were going to be forced to use Taskly, she wanted to know what they were dealing with. The commit history would tell the real story—how many developers, how much technical debt, how many last-minute fixes.

"I'll do some reconnaissance," she said. "If we're going to crash, I want to know why."

Mack grinned. "I'll start working on the workarounds. If this thing is as bad as I think it is, we're going to need them."

Jordan closed his notebook. "And I'll set up some meetings with the Innovation Lab. If we're going to make this work, we need to understand who we're working with."

They walked back toward their desks, each already planning their own survival strategy. The Digital Transformation Initiative 2.0 was about to begin, and they'd learned long ago that the best way to handle corporate initiatives was to prepare for the worst while hoping for something merely terrible.

Alex sat down at her desk and opened the Taskly repository. The README file was three lines long. The last commit was titled "fix urgent bug in production." The issue tracker had 247 open bugs and 3 contributors, two of whom hadn't committed anything in six months.

She opened a new document and started typing: "Taskly Migration: A Technical Assessment."

This was going to be interesting.

Meanwhile, Mack was already sketching out automation scripts. If they were going to be forced to feed metrics to a system that didn't understand their actual work, he might as well make it efficient. A few lines of Python could generate months of realistic-looking story points, velocity measurements, and productivity indicators.

Jordan was scheduling coffee meetings with Lisa Chen from the Innovation Lab. If the system was going to be a disaster, better to be seen as someone who tried to help rather than someone who just complained about it.

By the end of the day, each of them had their approach figured out. Alex would document the technical reality, Mack would build the workarounds, and Jordan would manage the politics.

They didn't coordinate these strategies—they just fell into them naturally, like water finding the path of least resistance.

Alex's technical assessment was already three pages long and growing. The Innovation Lab had built a project management system with no project management experience, using technologies they'd learned from YouTube tutorials, following architectural patterns they'd copied from blog posts.

Mack's automation script was already generating realistic sprint data. The system wanted velocity metrics? He'd give it velocity metrics that would make the charts look fantastic while revealing absolutely nothing about actual productivity.

Jordan's first meeting with the Innovation Lab was scheduled for tomorrow morning. He'd already prepared his questions, his diplomatic language, and his backup plans for when the diplomatic language inevitably failed.

Alex finished her technical assessment and saved it with the filename: "Why_Taskly_Will_Fail_A_Technical_Analysis.md"
