# Character Dynamics: Survival in Absurdity

## The Trio's Fundamental Dynamic

### Alex (The Cynic) + Mack (The Rebel) + Jordan (The Diplomat)
Three different ways to survive corporate absurdity:
- **Alex** analyzes the absurdity and finds ways to work around it
- **Mack** fights the absurdity directly and gets away with it
- **Jordan** navigates the absurdity by working within it

## Key Dynamic Elements

### 1. Cynical Camaraderie
- They're not friends who collaborate - they're colleagues who share the same prison
- They bond over their mutual recognition of the absurdity
- They provide each other with cynical commentary and commiseration
- They don't try to change each other or work together

### 2. Individual Survival Strategies
**Alex's Strategy**: "I see through the nonsense, so I can avoid the worst of it."
**Mack's Strategy**: "I break the rules because they're stupid anyway."
**Jordan's Strategy**: "I work the system because that's how you get ahead."

**The Dynamic**: They respect each other's approaches but don't try to coordinate them.

### 3. Shared Cynicism, Different Responses
- They all recognize the corporate absurdity
- They all have their own ways of dealing with it
- They don't judge each other's methods
- They provide each other with cynical humor and support

## Character Consistency (No Growth Arcs)

### Alex: The Eternal Cynic
- **Always**: Sees through corporate nonsense
- **Always**: Provides deadpan analysis of absurd situations
- **Always**: Finds ways to work around the system
- **Never Changes**: Remains cynical and analytical throughout

### Mack: The Eternal Rebel
- **Always**: Fights against stupid rules and processes
- **Always**: Gets away with breaking the rules
- **Always**: Provides energy and humor to the group
- **Never Changes**: Remains rebellious and defiant throughout

### Jordan: The Eternal Diplomat
- **Always**: Works within the system to get what he wants
- **Always**: Can negotiate with anyone
- **Always**: Provides a different perspective on situations
- **Never Changes**: Remains diplomatic and charming throughout

## Background Implications

### Mack (Ex-Startup Founder)
- **Experience**: Used to making decisions quickly and directly
- **Frustration**: Corporate processes feel slow and pointless
- **Approach**: Fights against bureaucracy because he knows it's unnecessary
- **Motivation**: Wants to build things, not navigate politics

### Jordan (Self-Taught, Worked Up from Support)
- **Experience**: Learned corporate politics from the ground up
- **Skill**: Knows how to work within the system to get things done
- **Approach**: Uses his knowledge of corporate culture to his advantage
- **Motivation**: Wants to succeed within the system, not fight it

## Dramatic Elements (Not Growth)

### The Absurdity Escalates
- Corporate nonsense gets worse over time
- Their individual survival strategies get tested
- But they don't change - the system just gets more absurd

### They Witness Each Other's Methods
- Alex sees Mack's rebellion and provides cynical commentary
- Mack sees Jordan's diplomacy and finds it amusing
- Jordan sees Alex's analysis and appreciates the insight
- But they don't try to coordinate or collaborate

### Shared Experiences, Individual Responses
- They all experience the same corporate events
- They all have their own ways of dealing with them
- They share cynical observations about what happened
- But they don't try to work together to change anything

## Dialogue Patterns

### Post-Meeting Commentary
- They gather after meetings to share cynical observations
- Each provides their own take on what just happened
- They don't try to solve problems together
- They just commiserate about the absurdity

### Individual Successes
- When one of them succeeds at something, the others provide cynical congratulations
- They don't try to replicate each other's methods
- They just appreciate that someone got one over on the system

### Individual Failures
- When one of them fails, the others provide cynical support
- They don't try to help each other improve
- They just acknowledge that the system is rigged

## Thematic Elements

### Survival, Not Victory
- The goal is to survive the absurdity, not change it
- Each character has their own survival strategy
- They don't try to coordinate their strategies
- The system remains unchanged

### Cynical Camaraderie
- They bond over shared recognition of absurdity
- They provide each other with humor and support
- But they don't try to change each other
- They accept each other's different approaches

### Individual Resistance
- Each character resists the system in their own way
- They don't coordinate their resistance
- They just do what works for them
- The system continues to be absurd

## Story Structure Implications

### No Character Growth
- Characters remain consistent throughout
- They don't learn to work together
- They don't change their approaches
- They just get better at their individual survival strategies

### No Systemic Change
- The corporate system remains absurd
- No meaningful reforms are achieved
- The characters just find better ways to survive
- The ending shows nothing has really changed

### Focus on Comedy and Commentary
- The humor comes from their individual responses to absurdity
- The drama comes from their shared recognition of the situation
- The story is about survival, not transformation
- The ending is cynical, not hopeful

## Key Scenes

### Post-Meeting Discussions
- They gather to share cynical observations
- Each provides their own take on events
- They don't try to solve problems together
- They just commiserate and joke

### Individual Triumphs
- One character succeeds at something
- Others provide cynical congratulations
- They don't try to replicate the success
- They just appreciate the small victory

### Individual Failures
- One character gets caught or fails
- Others provide cynical support
- They don't try to help fix the problem
- They just acknowledge the system's absurdity

This approach captures the authentic tone of *Catch-22* and *MASH* - characters who survive absurdity in their own ways, without trying to change each other or the system, finding humor and camaraderie in their shared recognition of the situation.
