# JIRA Internal Politics Subplot

## The Setup: Why Their Own System?

### The Internal Product Team
**The "Innovation Lab"**: A small team of engineers who built the JIRA system
- **Team Lead**: Sarah Chen (no relation to Alex) - ambitious middle manager
- **The Product**: "Taskly" - a "revolutionary" project management tool
- **The Reality**: Buggy, slow, missing basic features
- **The Marketing**: "Built by engineers, for engineers"

### The Political Pressure
**The General's Pet Project**: 
- The General (VP of Engineering) personally championed the internal Taskly system
- Claims it will "reduce vendor dependencies" and "showcase our engineering excellence"
- Has been pushing for company-wide adoption for months
- The Colonel is eager to please The General and prove her management worth

**Budget Politics**:
- The company spent $2M developing the internal Taskly system
- The General needs to justify this investment
- The Colonel sees this as an opportunity to demonstrate "cost savings"
- Management wants to show the board they can "build, not buy"

## The Escalating Absurdity

### Phase 1: The Announcement
**The Colonel's Presentation**:
- "We're migrating to our own Taskly system"
- Claims it will "streamline our workflow" and "improve transparency"
- Announces mandatory migration with 2-week deadline
- Presents this as a "strategic initiative" and "cost-saving measure"

**Alex's Discovery**:
- Finds out the system was built by their own company
- Discovers it's been in development for 18 months
- Realizes it's missing basic features that the old system had
- Documents the absurdity for future reference

### Phase 2: The Political Reality
**The Innovation Lab's Pressure**:
- Sarah Chen's team is under pressure to show adoption metrics
- The General has promised the board "100% internal tool adoption"
- The Innovation Lab's budget depends on proving the system works
- They're desperate for teams to use their product

**The Colonel's Motivation**:
- Wants to impress The General with her "change management skills"
- Sees this as an opportunity to demonstrate leadership
- Believes this will help her get promoted
- Ignores all technical concerns in favor of political goals

### Phase 3: The Technical Reality
**What the System Actually Does**:
- **Missing Features**: No bulk operations, no API, no integrations
- **Performance Issues**: Takes 30 seconds to load a simple task list
- **Buggy Behavior**: Random crashes, data corruption, lost work
- **Poor UX**: Counterintuitive interface, no keyboard shortcuts
- **No Documentation**: The Innovation Lab never wrote user guides

**What the Innovation Lab Claims**:
- "Revolutionary new interface design"
- "Advanced workflow automation"
- "Enterprise-grade security"
- "Seamless integration with existing tools"
- "Built with modern microservices architecture"

## The Character Responses

### Alex's Analysis
**Technical Assessment**:
- "This system has more bugs than features."
- "The Innovation Lab spent 18 months building a worse version of what we already had."
- "This migration will cost us more in lost productivity than the old system cost in licensing."

**Political Analysis**:
- "The General is trying to justify a $2M investment that should have been $200K."
- "The Colonel is using us as guinea pigs to impress her boss."
- "The Innovation Lab is desperate for adoption metrics to keep their budget."

### Mack's Rebellion
**Direct Action**:
- Creates a script to auto-generate story points to game the metrics
- Refuses to use the new system for actual work
- Keeps the old system running in parallel
- Documents every bug and sends it to the Innovation Lab

**Political Rebellion**:
- "I'm not using a system that's worse than what we had."
- "The Innovation Lab can fix their own bugs before forcing us to use it."
- "This is what happens when management builds products instead of engineers."

### Jordan's Diplomacy
**Behind-the-Scenes Negotiation**:
- Meets with Sarah Chen to discuss "improvement opportunities"
- Negotiates with IT to keep the old system running
- Convinces the Innovation Lab to prioritize critical bug fixes
- Sells the hybrid approach as "phased migration strategy"

**Political Maneuvering**:
- "Let me help you make this transition smoother for everyone."
- "We can be your beta testers while you work out the kinks."
- "A successful migration will reflect well on everyone involved."

## The Aftermath

### The Innovation Lab's Response
**Sarah Chen's Frustration**:
- "Why won't teams adopt our revolutionary system?"
- "They're not giving us a fair chance to prove ourselves."
- "The old system is holding us back from innovation."

**The General's Pressure**:
- Demands adoption metrics from The Colonel
- Threatens to cut Innovation Lab budget if adoption is low
- Blames the engineering teams for "resistance to change"

### The Colonel's Dilemma
**Caught in the Middle**:
- The General wants adoption metrics
- The teams refuse to use the buggy system
- The Innovation Lab is defensive about their product
- She needs to show "progress" without admitting the system is broken

**Her Solution**:
- Forces teams to log into the new system daily
- Requires them to create dummy tasks to boost metrics
- Claims the migration is "successful" based on login numbers
- Ignores actual usage and productivity data

### The Team's Survival Strategies
**Alex's Workaround**:
- Creates a script that automatically logs into the new system
- Documents all the bugs and inefficiencies
- Provides cynical commentary on the political motivations

**Mack's Resistance**:
- Continues using the old system for actual work
- Creates fake data in the new system to satisfy requirements
- Refuses to attend "training sessions" for the new system

**Jordan's Compromise**:
- Uses the new system for non-critical tasks
- Negotiates with the Innovation Lab for improvements
- Helps the team navigate the political requirements

## Thematic Elements

### Corporate Absurdity
- Internal politics forcing bad technical decisions
- Management building products instead of buying proven solutions
- Budget justification driving product adoption
- Metrics and appearances mattering more than actual functionality

### Technical vs. Political Reality
- Engineers know the system is bad
- Management only cares about adoption metrics
- Political goals override technical concerns
- The best technical solution is ignored for political reasons

### Character Dynamics
- **Alex**: Analyzes the political motivations behind the technical decision
- **Mack**: Rebels against using a system he knows is inferior
- **Jordan**: Negotiates to minimize the damage while satisfying political requirements

This subplot adds another layer of corporate absurdity - not just using a bad system, but being forced to use a bad system built by your own company for political reasons, while the people who built it are desperate for you to use it to justify their existence.
