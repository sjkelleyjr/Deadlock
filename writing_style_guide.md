# Writing Style Guide

## Character Development and Themes

### Survival Strategies Theme
- The three main characters (Alex, Mack, Jordan) have different approaches to dealing with corporate absurdity
- Alex: Analyzes and works around the nonsense
- Mack: Fights against stupid rules and gets away with it  
- Jordan: Negotiates through bureaucracy and turns it to his advantage

**Important**: This theme should be shown through character actions and dialogue, not explicitly stated. Avoid obvious lines like "Three different survival strategies for the same corporate absurdity" or similar exposition that spells out the theme too clearly.

### General Writing Principles
- Show, don't tell
- Let character differences emerge naturally through their responses to situations
- Trust readers to pick up on themes without heavy-handed explanation
- Maintain subtlety in character development
