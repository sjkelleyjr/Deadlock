# Chapter 5

Michael sat at his desk, staring at the Taskly adoption metrics report that Sarah had sent him. The numbers looked impressive—95% user adoption, 87% task completion rate, 92% satisfaction score. He knew they were fake. Everyone knew they were fake.

His phone buzzed with a text from his wife, Jenny. "How's your day going?"

"Fine," he replied automatically. He'd been saying "fine" for weeks now, even though nothing was fine.

The Taskly migration had been a disaster from day one. The system crashed constantly, lost data, and made simple tasks take three times longer. But Mack's script was generating beautiful metrics, and Vincent was thrilled with the "successful rollout." Michael had tried to explain the technical issues to Sarah, but she'd just smiled and said, "The numbers look great, Michael. Let's focus on the positive."

He opened his email and found seventeen new messages about the Digital Transformation Initiative. He deleted them all without reading them.

"Michael?" Alex appeared at his desk, carrying a coffee and looking concerned. "You okay? You've been staring at that screen for like ten minutes."

"I'm fine," Michael said, closing the Taskly report. "Just reviewing some metrics."

Alex glanced at the screen, then back at Michael. "Right. The metrics."

They both knew what she meant.

"How's the new feature coming along?" Michael asked, changing the subject.

"Slowly," Alex said. "The system keeps crashing every time I try to update a task. But I'm making progress."

Michael nodded. He wanted to tell her to stop using Taskly, to go back to the old system, to do whatever she needed to do to get her work done. But he couldn't. He was the technical lead. He was supposed to enforce the new processes, not undermine them.

"Keep me updated," he said instead.

Alex gave him a look that said she understood exactly what he wasn't saying. "Will do."

After Alex left, Michael opened his calendar and saw he had a one-on-one with Sarah in thirty minutes. He'd been dreading it all morning. Sarah would want to discuss the "excellent progress" they were making with Taskly, and he'd have to nod and smile and pretend everything was working perfectly.

His phone buzzed again. It was Jenny: "Sophie has a fever. I'm taking her to the doctor. Can you pick up Liam from soccer practice?"

Michael looked at his calendar. He had the one-on-one with Sarah, then a team meeting, then a call with the vendor about the new monitoring system. "I'll try," he replied. "What time is practice?"

"6:30. But if you can't make it, I can ask my mom."

Michael felt another pang of guilt. Jenny was always covering for him, always understanding when work took priority over family. But lately, it felt like work was taking priority over everything.

At 2 PM, he headed to Sarah's office for their one-on-one. Sarah was already there, organizing her workspace.

"Michael! Come in, come in. Have a seat."

He sat down across from her. The office was immaculate, everything in its place. Sarah's calendar was open to today's date, and she had a notebook ready for their meeting.

"How are you doing today?" Sarah asked.

"Fine," he replied automatically.  "How are you?"

"Oh, you know. Busy. Lots of exciting things happening with the Digital Transformation Initiative."

Michael nodded. "Yes, it's been quite a rollout."

"Exactly! And I wanted to talk to you about the Taskly adoption metrics. They're really impressive—95% user adoption, 87% task completion rate. Vincent is very pleased."

Michael felt his stomach clench. "The numbers do look good," he said carefully.

"They do! And I think this shows that our team is really embracing the new processes. The engineers seem to be adapting well."

Michael thought about Alex's comment about the system crashing every time she tried to update a task. He thought about Mack's script that was generating fake metrics.

"The team is very adaptable," he said.

Sarah smiled. "That's exactly what I wanted to hear. You know, Michael, I think you're doing a great job as technical lead. The engineers respect you, and you're helping them navigate this transition really well."

Michael felt another pang of guilt. He wasn't helping them navigate anything. He was just standing by while they worked around the broken system.

"Thank you," he said. "I'm trying my best."

"I can see that. And I wanted to let you know that Vincent has been very impressed with your leadership during this transition. He mentioned that you might be considered for a promotion in the next quarter."

Michael stared at her. "A promotion?"

"To Engineering Manager. You'd have your own team, more responsibility, better compensation. It's a great opportunity."

Michael felt sick. A promotion based on fake metrics and a broken system. A promotion that would mean more meetings, more reports, more time away from his family.

"That's very flattering," he said. "But I'm not sure I'm ready for that kind of responsibility."

Sarah's smile faltered slightly. "I understand. But think about it. You're already doing most of the work anyway. This would just make it official."

After the meeting, Michael walked back to his desk feeling exhausted. He sat down and stared at his computer screen, trying to process what had just happened.

"Everything okay?" Jordan appeared at his desk, carrying a notebook and looking concerned.

"Fine," Michael said automatically.

Jordan glanced at the closed Taskly report on his screen, then back at Michael. "Sarah's one-on-one go well?"

"It was...", he paused.

Jordan nodded slowly. "I see. Well, if you need anything, let me know. I'm here to help."

Michael looked at Jordan. He wanted to tell him everything—about the promotion offer, about his guilt over the fake metrics, about his fear that he was becoming part of the problem instead of the solution. But he couldn't. Jordan was his friend, but he was also an engineer. Michael was management now, or at least management-adjacent. There were things he couldn't discuss.

"Thanks, Jordan. I appreciate that."

After Jordan left, Michael opened his email and found a message from Vincent. "Great work on the Taskly rollout, Michael. The adoption metrics are exactly what we were looking for. Keep up the excellent work."

Michael stared at the email. The adoption metrics were fake. The system was broken. But Vincent was happy, Sarah was happy, and Michael was being offered a promotion. He was succeeding by every metric that mattered to the company, even though none of those metrics reflected reality.

His phone buzzed. It was Jenny again: "Sophie has strep throat. The doctor prescribed antibiotics. How's your day going?"

Michael looked at Vincent's email, then at the Taskly report, then at his calendar full of meetings about a system that didn't work.

"Fine," he replied. "Just another day at the office."

At 6:15, he packed up his laptop and headed for the elevator. He had fifteen minutes to get to Liam's soccer practice. If he left now, he could make it. If he stayed for the team meeting, he'd be late again.

His phone buzzed. It was Sarah: "Great meeting today, Michael. I'm excited about the possibilities for your future here at ByteSauce."

Michael pulled out of the parking lot and headed toward the soccer field. His phone buzzed again. It was Sarah: "Michael, I need you back in the office. Vincent wants to discuss the Taskly adoption metrics in person. He's very excited about the numbers and wants to understand how we achieved such success."

Michael stared at the message. At 6:15 PM.

He pulled over to the side of the road and called Jenny.

"Hey," she said. "Are you on your way to get Liam?"

"Actually," Michael said, "I need to go back to the office. Vincent wants to discuss the Taskly metrics."

"Right now? It's 6:15."

"I know. I'm sorry."

Jenny was quiet for a moment. "I'll ask my mom to pick up Liam."

Michael felt another pang of guilt. "I'm really sorry, Jenny. This shouldn't take long."

"Michael, this is the third time this week. Liam's been asking when you're going to come to one of his practices."

"I know. I'll make it up to him. I promise."

"Okay," Jenny said, but he could hear the disappointment in her voice. "Just let me know when you're on your way home."
