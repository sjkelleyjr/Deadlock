# Chapter 4

"Annual Performance Reviews - Mandatory Attendance," Alex read aloud, staring at the email that had just appeared in her inbox. She forwarded it to Mack and Jordan with the subject "Here we go again."

The review sessions were scheduled for the following week, with each engineer getting exactly thirty minutes with David from HR. The calendar invites included a link to a "pre-review self-assessment form" that was supposed to be completed at least 48 hours in advance.

Alex opened the form and immediately regretted it. The questions were written in corporate speak so dense it was almost unreadable.

"Please rate your performance across the following competency areas: Strategic Thinking, Innovation Mindset, Collaborative Excellence, Results Orientation, and Leadership Potential."

She stared at the screen. "What does any of that actually mean?"

Mack appeared at her desk, carrying a coffee and looking amused. "I just filled mine out. It took me three minutes."

"How?"

"I rated myself 'exceeds expectations' on everything and wrote 'see previous year's review' for all the comments."

Alex laughed. "They're not going to notice?"

"Notice what? That I copied last year's responses? They don't read these things anyway."

Jordan joined them, carrying his customary notebook and looking thoughtful. "Actually, I think we should take this seriously. Performance reviews can impact promotions and raises."

"Promotions?" Mack questioned. "To what? Senior Engineer? Tech Lead? Engineering Manager? No thanks."

"Raises, then," Jordan shrugged. "Money is money."

Alex was still staring at the form. "How am I supposed to rate my 'Strategic Thinking'? I write code. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Is that strategic?"

"Just put 'exceeds expectations' and move on," Mack advised. "Nobody cares about the actual content."

The self-assessment forms were due by Friday. By Thursday afternoon, Alex had managed to fill out one question. She was stuck on "Describe a time when you demonstrated exceptional leadership."

She'd never been in a leadership position. She'd never wanted to be in a leadership position. The closest she'd come was helping a junior developer debug a particularly nasty bug, but that felt more like basic human decency than leadership.

Jordan found her staring at the form at 4 PM. "Still working on that?"

"I'm trying to think of a time I demonstrated 'exceptional leadership,'" Alex admitted. "I'm drawing a blank."

"Just make something up," Jordan suggested. "Everyone does."

"Make something up?"

"Sure. Say you led a cross-functional team to deliver a critical feature under deadline. Say you mentored a junior developer who went on to become a senior engineer. Say you identified a major security vulnerability and coordinated the response team."

Alex stared at him. "But none of that actually happened."

"Doesn't matter. The point is to tell them what they want to hear."

Mack appeared behind them, carrying a stack of papers. "I just printed out last year's review forms. Want to see what I wrote?"

He handed Alex a sheet of paper. She read through it quickly. "This is exactly what you wrote this year."

"Yep. Word for word. And you know what? I got a 'meets expectations' rating and a three percent raise."

Jordan shook his head. "That's not how this is supposed to work."

"How is it supposed to work?" Mack challenged. "We fill out forms that nobody reads, have meetings that nobody remembers, and get ratings that don't mean anything. The whole thing is theater."

Alex looked at her form again. "I'm going to be honest. I'm going to write what I actually think."

Jordan and Mack exchanged glances.

"Good luck with that," Mack offered.

The review sessions started the following Monday. Alex was scheduled for 10 AM, Mack for 2 PM, and Jordan for 4 PM. David had booked a conference room on the third floor, far away from the engineering area.

Alex arrived five minutes early, carrying a copy of her self-assessment. David was already there, sitting behind a table with a laptop open and a stack of papers in front of him. He looked up when she entered and smiled nervously.

"Alex! Come in, come in. Have a seat."

She sat down across from him. The table was covered with HR forms, performance templates, and what looked like a checklist of talking points.

"How are you doing today?" David inquired.

"Fine," Alex responded. "How are you?"

"Oh, you know. Busy. Lots of reviews to get through this week."

He opened his laptop and clicked through a few screens. "Let me pull up your file here... Ah, yes. Alex Chen. Software Engineer. Let's see what we have here."

Alex watched as he scrolled through what appeared to be a very long document. "That's my file?"

"HR keeps very detailed records," David explained. "It's part of our comprehensive performance management system."

He continued scrolling. "I see you've been with ByteSauce for... three years now. And you're currently working on... let me find that... the Taskly migration project?"

"Among other things," Alex confirmed.

"Excellent. Now, let's go through your self-assessment. I see you rated yourself 'meets expectations' across most areas. That's very... honest of you."

Alex had indeed been honest. She'd rated herself "meets expectations" on everything except "Strategic Thinking," where she'd put "needs improvement" and written "I write functional code. I'm not strategic."

"Thank you," she acknowledged.

David cleared his throat. "Now, let me share some feedback from your manager and peers. Sarah has noted that you... let me find the exact quote... 'consistently delivers on commitments' and 'maintains high code quality standards.'"

"That's nice," Alex commented.

"However, there are some areas for improvement. She mentions that you could be 'more collaborative' and 'show more enthusiasm for company initiatives.'"

Alex stared at him. "What does that mean?"

David looked uncomfortable. "Well, you know. Being more... engaged. Participating in team activities. Supporting the company's vision."

"I participate in team activities," Alex defended. "I go to meetings. I do my work. What more do they want?"

"I think they're looking for more... enthusiasm. You know, excitement about new projects, willingness to take on additional responsibilities, that sort of thing."

Alex was starting to get annoyed. "I'm excited about writing good code. I'm willing to take on technical challenges. But I'm not going to pretend to be excited about corporate initiatives that don't make sense."

David shifted in his seat. "I understand. But you have to understand that management wants to see... engagement. They want to know that you're invested in the company's success."

"I am invested in the company's success," Alex insisted. "I want ByteSauce to succeed. I just don't think the way to do that is through meaningless metrics and broken systems."

David was quiet for a moment. "I see. Well, let me move on to the next section. Your overall rating for this year is... 'meets expectations.'"

"What does that mean for my raise?"

"Standard cost-of-living adjustment. Three percent."

Alex nodded. "So basically, nothing changes."

"Not exactly. You're still a valued member of the team. This rating reflects that you're meeting the expectations for your role."

"Right. And if I had rated myself higher on everything and written glowing self-assessments, would I have gotten a better rating?"

David looked even more uncomfortable. "The rating process is very thorough. We take into account multiple factors..."

"Like what?"

"Well, your manager's feedback, peer reviews, project contributions..."

"Which all say I'm doing fine," Alex pointed out. "So why am I getting a 'meets expectations' rating instead of 'exceeds expectations'?"

David was quiet again. "I think we should focus on the positive aspects of your performance. You're a solid engineer, and the team values your contributions."

"Thanks," Alex acknowledged. "But I'm still getting a three percent raise."

"Yes. That's correct."

The review wrapped up after another ten minutes of awkward conversation. David thanked her for her time and reminded her that she could appeal the rating if she disagreed with it.

Alex left the conference room feeling frustrated. She found Mack and Jordan in the break room.

"How'd it go?" Jordan inquired.

"About as well as expected," Alex reported. "I got a 'meets expectations' rating and a three percent raise."

"Same as last year," Mack observed. "And the year before that."

Jordan looked thoughtful. "What did you write in your self-assessment?"

"The truth. That I'm a competent engineer who does good work but doesn't pretend to be excited about corporate nonsense."

Mack laughed. "That's probably why you got 'meets expectations' instead of 'exceeds expectations.'"

"What do you mean?"

"They want you to drink the Kool-Aid," Mack explained. "If you'd written about how excited you are about the Digital Transformation Initiative and how you're looking forward to leveraging synergies to drive results, you'd probably have gotten a better rating."

Alex stared at him. "You're kidding."

"Nope. It's all about the buzzwords. The more corporate speak you use, the better your rating."

Jordan nodded. "It's true. I've seen the pattern. Engineers who use the right language get better reviews, regardless of actual performance."

"That's ridiculous," Alex protested.

"Of course it is," Mack agreed. "But that's how the system works."

Mack's review was at 2 PM. He came back looking amused.

"How'd it go?" Alex inquired.

"Great," Mack grinned. "I got an 'exceeds expectations' rating."

"What? How?"

"I told David that I was 'passionate about innovation' and 'excited to leverage emerging technologies to drive ByteSauce's digital transformation.' I said I was 'committed to collaborative excellence' and 'focused on delivering strategic value.'"

Alex stared at him. "You said all that?"

"Word for word. I memorized it from a LinkedIn post I saw last week."

"And he bought it?"

"Absolutely. He said I showed 'excellent growth potential' and 'strong leadership qualities.'"

Jordan's review was at 4 PM. He returned looking satisfied.

"Well?" Alex asked.

"'Exceeds expectations,'" Jordan reported. "Five percent raise."

"How did you manage that?"

"I used my diplomatic skills. I asked questions about the company's vision, expressed enthusiasm for new initiatives, and positioned my work as contributing to strategic goals. I also mentioned that I was interested in taking on more leadership responsibilities."

"Are you actually interested in leadership?" Mack questioned.

"Not really. But it's what they want to hear."

Alex shook her head. "So the system rewards people who lie about their enthusiasm and punishes people who are honest about their work."

"Pretty much," Mack confirmed.

"That's insane."

"It's corporate life," Jordan observed. "You learn to play the game or you get left behind."
