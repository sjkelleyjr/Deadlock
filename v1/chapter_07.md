# Chapter 7

Jordan adjusted his tie in the mirror of the hotel bathroom, checking that his collar was perfectly straight. The networking event was in full swing in the ballroom next door, and he could hear the murmur of conversation and the clink of glasses. He'd been to dozens of these events, but tonight felt different. Tonight, he was representing ByteSauce at the annual Tech Leaders Summit, and he knew there would be people here who could change his career trajectory.

He pulled out his phone and checked his LinkedIn profile one more time. His headline read "DevOps Engineer at ByteSauce | Cloud Infrastructure Specialist | Building Scalable Solutions" It was professional, technical, and just vague enough to sound impressive. He'd spent an hour crafting it, making sure it hit all the right keywords without being too obvious.

"Jordan?" A voice called from outside the bathroom. "Are you in there?"

He recognized the voice immediately. It was Sarah, his manager, who had insisted on attending the event with him. She'd been excited about the "networking opportunity" and had spent the entire car ride talking about how this could "elevate ByteSauce's profile in the tech community."

"Coming," he called back, giving himself one final check in the mirror. He looked good—dark suit, expensive watch, confident smile. He'd learned early in his sales career that people made snap judgments based on appearance, and he'd always been good at playing that game.

Sarah was waiting outside the bathroom, wearing a business suit and carrying a stack of business cards. She looked nervous, which was unusual for her. "There are so many people here," she said. "I don't know where to start."

Jordan smiled his most reassuring smile. "Don't worry, I'll introduce you around. These events are all about making connections."

They walked into the ballroom together. It was packed with tech professionals—engineers, managers, executives, and recruiters. The room was filled with the sound of networking: people exchanging business cards, discussing projects, and making small talk about the latest tech trends.

Jordan scanned the room, looking for familiar faces. He spotted several people he'd met at previous events, including a VP of Engineering from a competing company and a recruiter who'd tried to poach him last year. He also noticed a few people he'd been hoping to meet—senior engineers from major tech companies, startup founders, and industry influencers.

"Let's start over there," he said to Sarah, pointing toward a group of people near the bar. "I see someone I know."

They made their way through the crowd. Jordan moved with practiced ease, nodding to people he recognized and making eye contact with strangers. He'd learned that confidence was contagious, and people were naturally drawn to those who seemed comfortable in their own skin.

"Jordan!" A voice called out. He turned to see Marcus Chen, a former colleague who now worked at a major cloud provider. "How are you doing, man?"

"Marcus!" Jordan said, extending his hand for a firm handshake. "Great to see you. How's life at CloudCore?"

"Busy, but good. We're scaling like crazy. How about you? Still at ByteSauce?"

Jordan nodded. "Still there. We're going through some interesting changes with our digital transformation initiative."

Sarah perked up at the mention of the initiative. "Yes, we're implementing some really exciting new processes. Jordan has been instrumental in our Taskly migration."

Marcus raised an eyebrow. "Taskly? I haven't heard of that."

"It's our internal project management system," Sarah said. "We've achieved 95% user adoption."

Jordan felt a pang of guilt at the mention of the fake metrics, but he kept his smile in place. "It's been quite a rollout," he said diplomatically.

Marcus nodded, though Jordan could tell he wasn't particularly interested. "Well, if you're ever looking for a change, we're always hiring. The cloud space is exploding right now."

Jordan smiled. "I'll keep that in mind. Actually, I'd love to hear more about what you're working on. Maybe we could grab coffee sometime?"

"Absolutely," Marcus said, pulling out his phone. "Let me get your number."

They exchanged contact information, and Jordan felt a small thrill of satisfaction. Another connection made, another door opened. He'd learned that networking was like planting seeds—you never knew which ones would grow into opportunities.

Sarah was watching the exchange with interest. "That was impressive," she said. "You made that look so natural."

Jordan shrugged modestly. "It's just about being genuine and showing interest in what other people are doing."

They continued working the room, with Jordan introducing Sarah to various people and making connections of his own. He had a system for these events—he'd spend the first hour making initial contacts, the second hour deepening conversations with the most promising connections, and the final hour following up with people he'd met earlier.

As they moved through the crowd, Jordan noticed a woman standing alone near the appetizer table. She was dressed in a sharp business suit and had the confident posture of someone who was used to being in charge. He recognized her immediately—Jennifer Park, the VP of Engineering at TechFlow, one of the fastest-growing startups in the city.

"Excuse me for a moment," he said to Sarah. "I see someone I need to talk to."

He made his way over to Jennifer, who was examining a plate of canapés with apparent disinterest. "Jennifer Park?" he said, extending his hand. "Jordan Williams. I'm a big admirer of what you've built at TechFlow."

Jennifer looked up, surprised but not displeased. "Jordan Williams," she repeated, shaking his hand. "I don't think we've met."

"We haven't, but I've been following TechFlow's growth. Your microservices architecture is really impressive. I'd love to hear more about how you're handling the scaling challenges."

Jennifer's expression brightened. "You're familiar with our architecture?"

"Absolutely. I'm a DevOps engineer, and I've been studying how companies like yours are solving distributed systems problems. The way you've implemented your CI/CD pipeline is particularly interesting."

They spent the next twenty minutes discussing technical architecture, scaling challenges, and industry trends. Jordan was genuinely interested in what Jennifer had to say, but he was also carefully positioning himself as someone who could be valuable to her company. He asked thoughtful questions, shared relevant experiences from his own work, and made sure to highlight his technical expertise without being boastful.

"Jordan, you really know your stuff," Jennifer said. "We're actually looking for someone with your background. Are you open to new opportunities?"

Jordan smiled. "I'm always interested in hearing about interesting challenges. TechFlow is doing some really innovative work."

"Let's stay in touch," Jennifer said, pulling out a business card. "I'd love to have you come in for a conversation."

Jordan accepted the card and handed her one of his own. "I'd like that very much."

As Jennifer walked away, Jordan felt a surge of excitement. This was exactly the kind of opportunity he'd been hoping for. TechFlow was a hot company, and Jennifer was well-connected in the industry. A position there could be a major step up in his career.

But then he thought about his team at ByteSauce—Alex, Mack, Michael. They were his friends, and they were counting on him to help navigate the corporate nonsense. He'd been their diplomat, their negotiator, their buffer against the worst of management's demands.

He looked around the room and saw Sarah talking to a group of people, looking more comfortable than she had at the beginning of the evening. She was learning, he realized. She was starting to understand how these events worked, how to make connections, how to present herself professionally.

Jordan felt a pang of guilt. If he left ByteSauce, who would help the team navigate the corporate politics? Who would smooth things over with management when they inevitably made unreasonable demands? Who would be their diplomat?

He pulled out his phone and sent a quick text to his girlfriend, Amanda. "Networking event is going well. Might have an interesting opportunity. What do you think about TechFlow?"

Amanda was a lawyer, and she understood the importance of career advancement. She'd been encouraging him to look for opportunities that would advance his career and increase his earning potential. They were saving for a house, and a higher salary would help them reach their goal faster.

But Amanda also understood his loyalty to his team. She'd seen how much he cared about his colleagues, how he'd stayed up late helping them with problems, how he'd defended them in meetings when management was being unreasonable.

His phone buzzed with her response: "TechFlow is hot right now. But you love your team. What does your gut say?"

Jordan looked around the room again. He saw Marcus talking to a group of people, Jennifer making her way toward the exit, Sarah now confidently engaging with a senior executive. He thought about the absurdity of ByteSauce—the fake metrics, the broken systems, the corporate nonsense that never seemed to end.

But he also thought about the camaraderie he'd built with his team, the inside jokes, the shared frustration with the system, the way they'd learned to survive together. They were his people, and he was their diplomat.

He sent another text to Amanda: "My gut says stay. The team needs me. But I'm keeping the door open."

Amanda responded: "Makes sense. Love you."

Jordan put his phone away and made his way back to Sarah, who was now talking to a group of executives. She looked more comfortable than she had at the beginning of the evening.

"Jordan!" she called out. "Come meet David. He's the CTO at Inno, and he's very interested in our digital transformation initiative."

Jordan smiled and extended his hand. "David, great to meet you. I'd love to hear more about what you're working on at Inno."
