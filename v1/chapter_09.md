# Chapter 9

Mack sat at his desk, staring at his laptop screen with the kind of intensity that usually meant he was either solving a complex problem or about to start something completely new. Today, it was the latter.

He had three different projects open in his browser tabs, each one representing a different phase of his creative cycle. The first was a task automation script he'd started two weeks ago to help the team work around Taskly's limitations. The second was a personal project—a web app for tracking his mechanical keyboard collection. The third was a half-finished blog post about why corporate software development was fundamentally broken.

"Working on something interesting?" Alex appeared at his desk, looking curious.

"Always," Mack said, not looking up from his screen. "I'm trying to figure out why this automation script keeps crashing when it tries to generate fake metrics for Taskly."

Alex peered over his shoulder. "That's a lot of code for something that's supposed to be simple."

"Exactly," Mack said. "It started as a simple script to create fake login data. Now it's a full-blown system with error handling, logging, and a web interface. I think I might have over-engineered it."

Jordan joined them, carrying his notebook and looking amused. "Mack, you've over-engineered a script that's designed to generate fake data for a system that doesn't work. That's like putting a spoiler on a broken bicycle."

Mack grinned. "But it's a really nice spoiler."

The automation script had started as a simple Python script that would create fake user sessions in Taskly. But as Mack worked on it, he kept adding features. Now it had a database, a REST API, a web dashboard, and enough logging to track every fake action it performed.

"It's actually kind of beautiful," Mack said, scrolling through the code. "Look at this error handling. It's more robust than the actual Taskly system."

Alex stared at the screen. "You've written 500 lines of code to generate fake data for a broken system."

"600 lines," Mack corrected. "And it's not just fake data. It's realistic fake data. The patterns match real user behavior. The timestamps are properly distributed. The error rates are statistically accurate."

Jordan shook his head. "You realize this is exactly the kind of thing that would make management think Taskly is working great, right?"

"That's the beauty of it," Mack said. "They see the metrics improving, they think the system is working, and they leave us alone. Meanwhile, we can actually get our work done."

Alex looked at the other tabs on his screen. "What's the keyboard collection tracker?"

Mack switched tabs to show a web application with a grid of mechanical keyboards, each with detailed specifications and ratings. "I have 12 mechanical keyboards now. I needed a way to keep track of them."

"Twelve?" Jordan said. "Why do you need twelve keyboards?"

"Different switches for different moods," Mack said. "Cherry MX Blues for when I'm feeling productive, Browns for when I need to be quiet, Reds for gaming. Plus, I'm building a custom one with hand-wired switches."

Alex stared at the application. "You've built a full web app to track your keyboard collection."

"It's not just tracking," Mack said. "It has a recommendation engine. Based on your typing style and preferences, it suggests which keyboard you should use for different tasks."

Jordan laughed. "You've built a recommendation engine for keyboards."

"Hey, it's a real problem," Mack said. "You wouldn't believe how much time I was wasting trying to decide which keyboard to buy next."

The third tab contained Mack's blog post, which was currently titled "Why Corporate Software Development is Fundamentally Broken (And Why Nobody Cares)." He'd written about 2,000 words but had stopped mid-sentence.

"How's the blog post coming?" Alex asked.

Mack switched to that tab and stared at the incomplete sentence. "I got distracted by the keyboard app. I'll finish it later."

"You always say that," Jordan said.

"I know," Mack said. "But this time I mean it. I've got some really good points about how corporate development prioritizes process over product."

Alex read the partial sentence on screen: "The fundamental problem with corporate software development is that it's designed to make managers feel good about themselves rather than to produce working software. When you prioritize—"

"You stopped mid-sentence," Alex said.

"I was going to say 'When you prioritize metrics over results, you get exactly what you measure: meaningless numbers that look good in presentations but don't actually solve real problems.' But then I started thinking about the keyboard app again."

Mack's phone buzzed with a text from his girlfriend, Jessica. "Hey, are you still coming over tonight? I want to show you the new marketing campaign I'm working on."

Mack typed back: "Of course! Can't wait to see it."

Jessica worked in marketing at a different company, and she was always excited to show Mack her latest campaigns. The problem was that she didn't really understand what Mack did for a living.

"What does your girlfriend think about all your side projects?" Alex asked.

Mack shrugged. "She thinks I'm 'creative' and 'passionate about technology.' She doesn't really get the technical details, but she's supportive. Last week she asked me if I could help her set up a spreadsheet for tracking social media metrics."

"Did you help her?" Jordan asked.

"I built her a full analytics dashboard with real-time data visualization," Mack said. "It was supposed to be a simple spreadsheet."

Alex laughed. "Of course you did."

Mack's side projects were legendary among his roommates. He lived with two other developers, and they had weekly "hack nights" where they'd work on personal projects together. The problem was that Mack would start something ambitious, get excited about it, work on it obsessively for a few days, then move on to something else.

His roommates had learned to expect this pattern. They'd come home to find Mack hunched over his laptop, surrounded by empty coffee cups and energy drink cans, working on something completely different from what he'd been doing the day before.

"Remember the time you built that smart home automation system?" Alex asked.

Mack grinned. "The one that would turn off the lights when you left the room and adjust the thermostat based on your schedule? That was a good one."

"You spent three weeks on it," Jordan said. "Then you moved on to building a cryptocurrency trading bot."

"And before that, it was the recipe recommendation app," Alex said. "And before that, the fitness tracking system."

"I get bored easily," Mack said. "There are just so many interesting problems to solve."

The problem was that Mack's side projects were often more interesting than his day job. At ByteSauce, he was working on maintaining legacy systems and implementing corporate processes that made no sense. But in his free time, he was building things that actually solved real problems.

His latest obsession was the keyboard collection tracker, which had started as a simple spreadsheet but had grown into a full web application with user authentication, a recommendation engine, and a REST API. He'd even started thinking about adding machine learning to predict which keyboard someone would prefer based on their typing patterns.

"Are you going to finish any of these projects?" Jordan asked.

"Eventually," Mack said. "I'm just waiting for the right moment. You know, when the inspiration strikes."

Alex looked at the three tabs on his screen. "You have three different projects open right now, and you're not working on any of them."

"I'm thinking about them," Mack said. "That counts as work."

The truth was that Mack's side projects were his way of staying sane in the corporate environment. When he was working on something he actually cared about, he could forget about the absurdity of ByteSauce and focus on solving real problems.

But his inability to finish anything was starting to bother him. He had dozens of half-finished projects scattered across his GitHub account, each one representing a burst of creative energy that had fizzled out before completion.

"I should probably focus on one thing at a time," Mack said, looking at his screen.

"Which one?" Alex asked.

Mack stared at the three tabs for a moment. "I don't know. Maybe I'll start something new."

Jordan laughed. "There's the Mack we know and love."

Mack grinned and opened a new tab. "I've been thinking about building a system to track all my unfinished projects. You know, to help me stay organized."

Alex and Jordan exchanged glances.

"Maybe I can just use Taskly.", he said.  They all laughed.

"Or maybe I'll work on the automation script some more," Mack said. "I think I can make it even more realistic."

He switched back to the Taskly automation script and started typing. The code flowed easily, and he was soon lost in the rhythm of programming. This was what he loved—solving problems, building things, creating order out of chaos.

Mack typed away, adding more features to his automation script, while his other projects waited patiently in their tabs. He'd get back to them eventually. Probably.
