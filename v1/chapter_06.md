# Chapter 6

The conference room was set up for what Sarah called a "proper agile sprint planning session." There were sticky notes, whiteboards covered in columns labeled "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done," and a stack of index cards that had been purchased specifically for this meeting.

Alex sat at the table, watching Sarah organize the materials with the precision of someone who'd watched too many YouTube videos about agile methodology. She'd even brought a timer, which she placed prominently in the center of the table.

"Good morning, everyone!" Sarah said. "Today we're going to do our first proper sprint planning session. We'll be using story points to estimate our work, and we'll commit to what we can realistically accomplish in the next two weeks."

Mack dropped into the chair next to Alex, carrying a coffee and looking amused.

Michael arrived last, looking tired and carrying a stack of papers. He sat down at the head of the table and opened his laptop. "Thanks for coming, everyone. Sarah has prepared a comprehensive sprint planning session for us."

"Excellent!" Sarah said, clapping her hands together. "Let's start with the sprint goal. Our objective for the next two weeks is to deliver the new user authentication system, the reporting dashboard, and the mobile app integration."

Alex stared at her. "All three? In two weeks?"

"Exactly!" Sarah said. "With proper agile methodology, we can accomplish much more than we think. The key is breaking everything down into small, manageable stories."

She began writing on the whiteboard. "Let's start with the user authentication system. How many story points would you estimate for that?"

Mack raised his hand. "I have a question. What exactly is a story point?"

Sarah smiled patiently. "A story point is a unit of measure for the complexity of a task. We use the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. The higher the number, the more complex the task."

"Right," Mack said. "But what does that actually mean? Is a 5-point story twice as complex as a 3-point story, or five times as complex?"

"It's relative." Sarah said.  "You compare stories to each other. If this story feels twice as complex as that story, you give it twice as many points."

"Okay," Mack said. "So for the user authentication system, I'd estimate about 21 points."

"Twenty-one?" Sarah said, looking shocked. "That seems very high."

Mack shrugged. "We need to implement OAuth 2.0, handle password reset flows, integrate with our existing user database, add two-factor authentication, and make sure it's secure. That's a lot of work."

Sarah shook her head. "I think you're overestimating. Let's call it 8 points."

"Eight?" Mack said. "That's not even close to realistic."

"Remember," Sarah said, "in agile, we want to be optimistic. We can always adjust our estimates as we learn more."

Alex raised her hand. "What about the reporting dashboard? How many points for that?"

Sarah brightened. "Great question! The reporting dashboard should be about 5 points. It's mostly just displaying data that already exists."

Alex stared at her. "The reporting dashboard needs to aggregate data from six different systems, handle real-time updates, support multiple export formats, and include customizable charts and graphs. That's at least 13 points."

"Thirteen?" Sarah said. "That seems excessive. Let's call it 5."

Jordan cleared his throat. "I think we might be approaching this from the wrong angle. Instead of focusing on the technical complexity, maybe we should think about the business value. What's the most important thing we need to deliver?"

Sarah nodded appreciatively. "Excellent point, Jordan. That's exactly the kind of thinking we need. What do you think is the most important feature?"

Jordan smiled. "I think the mobile app integration is the highest priority. It will have the biggest impact on user engagement."

"Perfect!" Sarah said. "So let's focus on that first. How many points for the mobile app integration?"

Jordan thought for a moment. "I'd say about 3 points. It's mostly just API endpoints that we already have."

"Three points?" Mack said. "We need to build a complete mobile API, handle authentication, implement push notifications, and make sure it works across iOS and Android. That's at least 13 points."

Sarah shook her head. "Jordan is right. Let's keep it simple. Three points."

Alex looked at Mack, then at Jordan, then back at Sarah. "So we're estimating three features that should take about 47 points total, but we're calling them 16 points, and we're supposed to deliver them all in two weeks?"

"Exactly!" Sarah said. "That's the beauty of agile. We focus on delivering value quickly, not on getting bogged down in details."

Michael spoke up for the first time. "Sarah, I think we need to be more realistic about our estimates. The team is telling us these features are complex."

Sarah's smile became strained. "Michael, I understand your concern. But we need to think about velocity. If we start with conservative estimates, we'll never improve our delivery speed."

"Velocity?" Mack said. "How is that defined?"

"Velocity is how many story points we complete per sprint," Sarah said. "The goal is to increase our velocity over time."

"Right," Mack said. "So if we estimate everything at 1 point, our velocity will be amazing."

"Exactly! That's the spirit." said Sarah, completely missing the joke.

Alex raised her hand again. "I have a question about the sprint commitment. Are we supposed to commit to all three features?"

"Absolutely!" Sarah said. "We need to show that agile methodology works. The board is expecting to see significant progress on all three initiatives."

Jordan cleared his throat again. "I think we might want to consider a more phased approach. Maybe we could focus on one feature per sprint, and really nail it before moving on to the next one."

Sarah shook her head. "That's not agile. In agile, we deliver working software every sprint. We can't wait three sprints to see results."

"Working software.  As opposed to the broken software we're currently using?" Alex snickered.

"Maybe the Taskly team should've considered agile." chuckled Mack.

Mack leaned back in his chair. "So we're supposed to deliver three complex features in two weeks, with unrealistic estimates, and make sure they actually work?"

"Exactly!" Sarah said. "Now let's break these down into smaller stories. Each story should be completable in one day."

She began writing on the whiteboard again. "For the user authentication system, we have: 'User can log in with email and password' - that's 1 point. 'User can reset password' - that's 1 point. 'User can enable two-factor authentication' - that's 1 point."

Alex stared at the whiteboard. "Each of those is a 1-point story?"

"Of course!" Sarah said. "They're simple features."

"Simple features that require security audits, database changes, email integration, and mobile app updates," Alex said.

Sarah waved her hand dismissively. "Details. The important thing is that we're delivering value to the user."

Jordan spoke up again. "I think we might be missing an opportunity here. Instead of trying to do everything at once, maybe we could focus on the minimum viable product. We could deliver a basic authentication system first, then add features incrementally."

Sarah brightened. "Jordan, that's exactly the kind of agile thinking we need! You're absolutely right. Let's focus on the MVP."

"Great," Jordan said. "So for the MVP, I'd suggest we focus on basic login functionality. That's probably about 3 points."

"Perfect!" Sarah said. "Three points for basic login. That's much more realistic."

Mack glanced at Jordan, amazed that he was able to convince Sarah that the task she had just said was 1 point had now become 3 points.

Jordan glanced backed at Mack and grinned slyly.

Sarah continued writing on the whiteboard. "So our sprint goal is: 'User can log in with email and password.' That's 3 points. We can definitely do that in two weeks."

Alex looked at the whiteboard. "So we went from three complex features to one simple feature?"

"Exactly!" Sarah said. "That's the power of agile. We focus on what's most important and deliver it quickly."

Michael nodded slowly. "That does seem more realistic."

"Of course it does," Sarah said. "Now let's plan our daily standups. We'll meet every morning at 9 AM to discuss what we did yesterday, what we're doing today, and any blockers."

"Every morning?" Mack said.

"Every morning," Sarah said. "That's how we stay aligned and remove obstacles quickly."

Alex raised her hand. "What if we don't have any blockers?"

"Then you say 'no blockers' and we move on," Sarah said. "It's very efficient."

"Very efficient" Alex said dryly.

Jordan cleared his throat. "I think we might want to consider making the standups optional. Some people work better when they're not interrupted first thing in the morning."

Sarah shook her head. "Standups are mandatory. That's how we build team cohesion and ensure accountability."

"Daily standups," Mack said. "For a login form."

"Exactly!" Sarah said, missing the point yet again. "Now let's set up our sprint board. We'll use Taskly to track our progress."

Alex groaned. "Taskly?"

Sarah's smile faltered. "Taskly is our official project management tool. We need to use it for consistency."

Jordan spoke up again. "I think we might be able to help with the Taskly adoption. Maybe we could create a simple template for our stories that makes it easier to use."

Sarah brightened. "Jordan, that's a great idea! You could help coordinate the Taskly integration for the team."

Jordan's smile faltered slightly. "I... of course. I'd be happy to help facilitate the process." he said behind gritted teeth.

Mack glanced at Jordan and grinned.

The meeting continued for another hour, with Sarah explaining the finer points of agile methodology while the engineers tried to figure out how to make it work with their actual constraints. By the end, they had committed to a 3-point story that should have been 8 points, scheduled daily standups that no one wanted to attend, and assigned Jordan to coordinate the Taskly integration.
