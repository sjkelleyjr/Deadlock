# Chapter 14

Brad from Optimize arrived at 1:45 PM, fifteen minutes early for his demo. Alex watched him set up his laptop in the conference room, carefully arranging his business cards in a neat stack on the table. His polo shirt was pressed, his laptop was spotless, and he had the kind of practiced smile that suggested he'd given this presentation hundreds of times.

The engineers filed in at 2 PM, taking seats at the back of the room. Vincent was already there, sitting in the front row with a notebook open and a pen ready. He looked excited, like a kid about to see a magic show.

"Welcome, everyone!" Bradley began. "Today I'm going to show you how our platform can revolutionize your workflow."

Vincent nodded enthusiastically and started taking notes. Alex noticed he was writing down every buzzword Bradley used.

"Our platform provides a unified view of your entire workflow," Bradley said, clicking to his first slide.

Vincent wrote "unified view" in his notebook and underlined it twice.

"With real-time analytics and AI-powered insights," Bradley continued.

Vincent wrote "AI-powered insights" and added three exclamation marks.

Mack leaned over to Alex. "Vincent's taking notes like he's studying for an exam."

Alex nodded. "He's going to try to implement every buzzword he hears."

Bradley continued his presentation, using phrases like "paradigm shift," "disruptive innovation," and "synergistic optimization." Vincent wrote down each one, sometimes asking Bradley to repeat them so he could get the spelling right.

"Could you spell 'synergistic'?" Vincent asked, pen poised over his notebook.

"S-Y-N-E-R-G-I-S-T-I-C," Bradley said, clearly pleased that someone was taking such detailed notes.

Vincent wrote it down carefully, then added "optimization" underneath it. He was building a dictionary of corporate innovation, one buzzword at a time.

"Now, let me show you our dashboard," Bradley said, clicking to a new slide.

The slide showed a screenshot of what looked like a standard business dashboard. There were charts, graphs, and various metrics displayed in a grid layout.

"Beautiful," Vincent said, writing "dashboard" in his notebook.

Alex stared at the screen. The dashboard looked like every other business dashboard she'd ever seen - generic charts with sample data, meaningless metrics, and corporate jargon. There were pie charts showing "Productivity Distribution," bar graphs labeled "Efficiency Metrics," and a gauge that read "Optimization Score: 87%."

"Notice how intuitive the interface is," Bradley said. "Everything is just one click away."

Vincent nodded and wrote "intuitive interface" in his notebook. He also wrote "one-click access" and drew a small arrow pointing to it.

"Each widget is customizable," Bradley continued. "You can drag and drop them to create your perfect dashboard."

Vincent wrote "customizable widgets" and "drag and drop" in his notebook. He was creating a feature checklist that would become his implementation roadmap.

Jordan raised his hand. "What am I looking at?"

"This is your workflow efficiency dashboard," Bradley said. "It shows key metrics like task completion rates, time tracking, and productivity trends."

"Those look like generic charts with sample data," Alex said.

"They are sample data," Bradley's colleague Priya said. "We'll populate it with your actual data once we integrate."

"So you're showing us what our data might look like if we had your platform?" Alex asked.

"Exactly," Bradley said. "This gives you a preview of what you'll see once we're up and running."

Vincent was still taking notes. He wrote "preview of actual data" and underlined it.

"Now, let me show you our advanced analytics module," Bradley said, clicking to a new slide.

The slide showed more charts and graphs, this time with labels like "Predictive Analytics," "Trend Analysis," and "Performance Forecasting."

Vincent wrote "advanced analytics" and "predictive analytics" in his notebook. He also wrote "trend analysis" and "performance forecasting," underlining each one.

"This module uses machine learning to predict future performance based on historical data," Bradley explained.

"Can you explain what 'machine learning' means in this context?" Jordan asked.

Bradley looked pleased to have a technical question. "Our algorithms analyze patterns in your workflow data and identify trends that can help predict future outcomes."

"Now, let me show you our AI-powered recommendation engine," Bradley said.

The slide showed a screenshot of what looked like a chat interface with some text bubbles.

"This is our AI assistant," Bradley said. "It can answer questions about your workflow and provide recommendations."

Vincent wrote "AI assistant" and "recommendations" in his notebook.

"What kind of questions?" Mack asked.

"Questions like 'How can I improve my team's productivity?' or 'What are the bottlenecks in our current process?'"

Vincent wrote "productivity questions" and "bottleneck identification" in his notebook.

Alex watched as Vincent continued to document every feature, every promise, every buzzword. He was creating a shopping list of corporate solutions.

Bradley moved on to pricing. "Our platform starts at $50,000 per year for the basic package."

Vincent wrote "$50,000" and "basic package" in his notebook.

"With additional modules available for $15,000 each," Bradley continued.

Vincent wrote "$15,000 per module" and added a note about "scalable investment."

"Plus implementation fees of $25,000," Bradley added.

Vincent wrote "$25,000 implementation" and underlined it twice.

"And annual maintenance of 20% of the total cost," Bradley said.

Vincent calculated quickly in his notebook: "$50,000 + $25,000 + $10,000 = $85,000 first year." He wrote "annual maintenance 20%" and drew a box around the total.

Alex watched as Vincent documented the entire cost structure, building a budget that would become his justification for the investment. She could see the wheels turning in his head - he was already planning how to present this to the board.

The presentation continued for another thirty minutes. Bradley showed more slides, used more buzzwords, made more promises. Vincent took notes on everything.

Alex watched the process with growing concern. Vincent was going to try to implement every feature Bradley mentioned, regardless of whether they made sense or whether the company could afford them.

As the presentation wrapped up, Bradley asked if there were any questions.

Vincent raised his hand. "This is exactly what we need. When can we get started?"

Bradley smiled. "We can begin the implementation process as soon as you're ready."

Vincent nodded enthusiastically. "Perfect. I'll have our legal team review the contract and we can get this rolling."

Alex exchanged glances with Mack and Jordan. They all knew what was coming - another expensive corporate solution that would create more problems than it solved.

Mack leaned over and whispered, "Vincent's going to try to implement every feature Bradley mentioned."

Jordan nodded. "And we'll be the ones who have to make it all work."

Alex sighed. "I can already see the meeting next week: 'We need to implement the synergistic optimization features with predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms.'"

Mack grinned. "Don't forget the customizable widgets and drag-and-drop interface."

Jordan added, "And the AI-powered recommendation engine that provides actionable insights."

They all knew the drill. Vincent would present his notes as a strategic roadmap, the board would approve the budget, and the engineers would be left to figure out how to make it all work with systems that didn't need integrating and tools that didn't provide any value.

As the vendor team packed up their equipment, Vincent approached Bradley with his notebook open.

"Can you go over those key features again?" Vincent asked. "I want to make sure I have everything documented correctly."

Bradley smiled and started listing off the features. Vincent wrote them down, one by one, building his roadmap for corporate transformation.  Alex watched the process with a sense of inevitability.

It was just another day in the corporate circus - another vendor selling solutions to problems that didn't exist, another manager buying into the promise of transformation, another round of engineers left to clean up the mess.

Bradley was still talking to Vincent, going through his notebook page by page. The contract was as good as signed.

Alex looked at her watch. It was almost 4 PM. She had a meeting with Sarah in fifteen minutes to discuss the new project requirements.

She wondered how many more vendor demos she'd have to sit through in her career, how many more corporate solutions she'd have to pretend to implement, how many more buzzwords she'd have to translate into actual work.

The answer, she suspected, was "many."

Bradley was showing Vincent how to use the platform's "synergistic optimization features." Vincent was taking notes.

Alex stood up and walked out of the conference room. She had work to do.
