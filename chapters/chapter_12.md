# Chapter 12

The security audit wasn't just another meeting this time. It was a reckoning.

Alex noticed the difference as soon as she walked into the conference room. There were more people than usual—Sarah from engineering, David from HR, even Lisa from the Innovation Lab, all looking tense. On the whiteboard, someone had written "Root Cause Analysis" in red marker and circled it three times.

Vincent stood at the front, holding a stack of printouts. "Before we begin, I want to thank everyone for their hard work on the recent budget research project. The executive team was… impressed by the thoroughness." He didn't sound impressed.

Mack leaned over to Jordan. "Translation: They realized we turned a budget cut into a six-week paid vacation."

Jordan didn't smile. "I think they're onto us."

Vincent cleared his throat. "Unfortunately, the auditors have found several… anomalies. For example, our password policy requires a minimum of 16 characters, two uppercase letters, a symbol, and a haiku. Yet, somehow, the most common password in the system is 'password123.'"

Sarah jumped in. "We followed the compliance checklist. Every box is checked."

David from HR nodded. "The checklist is very clear. If the box is checked, the requirement is met."

Alex raised her hand. "But the checklist says, 'Ensure passwords are secure.' It doesn't define secure."

Vincent's eyes narrowed. "That's why we're here. We need to ensure compliance with the checklist, and also ensure that compliance actually means something."

Mack grinned. "So, to be clear, we need to comply with the checklist, but also not comply with it if compliance doesn't mean compliance?"

Vincent hesitated. "We need to be compliant, but not just compliant. Securely compliant."

Lisa from the Innovation Lab piped up. "Maybe we can automate the compliance process. If the system detects a non-compliant password, it can automatically change it to something compliant."

Jordan frowned. "But if the system changes the password, the user won't know it. They'll be locked out."

Sarah nodded. "And then they'll call IT, who will reset it to 'password123' again."

Vincent scribbled something on his notepad. "We need a process to ensure the process is being followed, and a process to ensure the process for following the process is also being followed."

Alex whispered, "We've reached process singularity."

The auditors began their presentation. Slide after slide of charts, graphs, and compliance matrices. Every time a potential issue was raised, someone pointed to a different process, a different checklist, a different compliance tool.

At one point, David from HR said, "We can't update the security policy until the new policy is approved, but the approval process requires the policy to already be in effect."

Mack's eyes lit up. "That's beautiful. It's like a Möbius strip of bureaucracy."

By the end of the meeting, nothing had been resolved. The auditors had recommended a new task force to review the compliance process, which would report back after the next audit. Vincent looked exhausted.

As the engineers left the room, Alex said, "Did we just survive a security audit by proving that security is impossible?"

Mack shrugged. "We survived by making the process so circular that nobody could figure out where to start."

Jordan checked his phone. "We have a follow-up meeting scheduled for next week. The agenda is 'Review of the Review Process.'"
