# Chapter 1: The All-Hands Meeting

The conference room smelled like stale coffee and desperation. Alex sat in her usual spot near the back, watching the rest of the engineering team file in. She'd arrived ten minutes early, and had already counted the corporate buzzwords in the agenda. Seventeen. A new record.

"Digital Transformation Initiative 2.0," she muttered to herself, reading the first slide. "Because 1.0 was such a resounding success."

Mack plopped down in the chair next to her, headphones still around his neck. "What fresh hell is this?" he asked, nodding at the projector screen.

"Apparently we're being 'transformed' again," Alex said. "I'm guessing this involves new processes that will make everything slower and more complicated."

"Classic," Mack said, pulling out his phone. "I'm already documenting this for my 'Corporate Bingo' game."

Jordan slid into the seat on Alex's other side, carrying a notebook and three different colored pens. "Hey," he said with a smile that suggested he knew something they didn't. "I have it on good authority that this is going to be interesting."

"Define 'interesting,'" Alex said.

"Vincent's pet project," Jordan said, opening his notebook. "He's been working on this for months."

The room filled up quickly. Sarah, their engineering manager, stood at the front of the room, organizing her presentation materials with the precision of someone who'd practiced this moment in front of a mirror. Michael, their technical lead, hovered near the door, looking like he wanted to be anywhere else.

"Good morning, everyone!" Sarah said, her voice artificially bright. "I'm excited to share some exciting news about our company's future."

Vincent, VP of Engineering, made his grand entrance five minutes late. He wore expensive casual wear and carried the latest iPhone, which he used to check something important as he walked to the front of the room. The entire team turned to watch him, like flowers following the sun.

"Thanks for coming, everyone," Vincent said, not looking up from his phone. "I know you're all busy, so I'll keep this brief."

Alex glanced at her watch. They were already ten minutes behind schedule. "Brief," she whispered to Mack. "That's corporate speak for 'I'm going to talk for an hour.'"

"Before we dive into the details," Vincent continued, "I want to share a personal story. When I was building my first startup, we had this incredible culture of innovation and disruption. We weren't afraid to fail fast and pivot quickly. That's the kind of energy I want to bring to this team."

Jordan was taking notes. Alex could see him writing something that looked suspiciously like a pros and cons list.

"Today," Vincent said, finally putting his phone away, "I'm announcing our Digital Transformation Initiative 2.0. This isn't just about updating our tools—it's about transforming our entire approach to software development."

Sarah stepped forward, clearly eager to contribute. "We'll be implementing a comprehensive suite of new processes designed to optimize our velocity and increase our throughput."

"Velocity and throughput," Alex muttered. "Two words that mean absolutely nothing when you're dealing with legacy code that hasn't been touched in five years."

Mack was typing something on his phone. "I'm creating a drinking game," he whispered. "Every time someone says 'digital transformation,' we take a shot."

"Please don't," Alex said. "I don't want to explain to HR why we're all drunk at 10 AM."

Vincent continued his presentation, which involved a lot of hand gestures and phrases like "paradigm shift" and "disruptive innovation." Alex counted the buzzwords on her fingers. By the time she got to the third slide, she'd run out of fingers.

"Now, let me introduce you to our new productivity metrics," Sarah said, taking over. "We'll be tracking story points, velocity, burndown charts, and—"

"Story points?" Mack interrupted. "We're not even using agile methodology."

Sarah's smile didn't waver, but Alex could see the panic in her eyes. "That's exactly why we need this transformation! We're moving to a fully agile approach with two-week sprints, daily standups, and comprehensive retrospectives."

Jordan raised his hand. "What about our current projects? We have several features in development that are already behind schedule."

"Excellent question," Vincent said, stepping back in. "We'll be doing a complete reset. All current work will be re-evaluated through our new agile framework."

Alex felt a headache coming on. "So we're going to stop everything we're doing, learn a new methodology, and somehow deliver more features faster?"

"Exactly!" Sarah said, clearly missing the sarcasm. "The new system will help us identify bottlenecks and optimize our workflow."

Michael, their technical lead, finally spoke up. "I have some concerns about the timeline. We have a major release scheduled for next month."

Vincent waved his hand dismissively. "We'll pivot. That's what agile is all about—being flexible and responsive to change."

"Pivot," Alex whispered to Mack, rolling her eyes.

Mack was now fully engaged in his phone. "I'm live-tweeting this meeting," he said. "My followers are going to love this."

"Please don't," Jordan said, but he was smiling. "Though I have to admit, this is going to be interesting to watch."

The presentation continued for another forty-five minutes. Vincent talked about "innovation culture" and "failing fast," while Sarah explained how the new metrics would help them "move the needle" and "drive results." Alex counted thirty-seven buzzwords by the end.

"Any questions?" Vincent asked, looking around the room.

Alex raised her hand. "Just one. How exactly is this going to make us more productive when we're spending all our time learning new processes and filling out new forms?"

Vincent's smile faltered slightly. "That's a great question, Alex. The initial learning curve might be steep, but once we're all on the same page, our efficiency will increase dramatically."

"Right," Alex said. "Because nothing says 'efficiency' like having daily meetings about how to have better meetings."

A few people chuckled. Sarah's smile became more strained.

"Let's keep an open mind," Jordan said smoothly. "Change can be challenging, but it also presents opportunities. I'm sure we can find ways to make this work for everyone."

Vincent nodded appreciatively. "Exactly. That's the kind of positive attitude we need. Jordan, I'd like you to help coordinate the transition."

"Of course," Jordan said, making a note in his notebook. "I'd be happy to help facilitate the process."

The meeting ended with Sarah distributing packets of information about the new processes. Alex flipped through her packet and found seventeen different forms that would need to be filled out weekly.

"Seventeen forms," he said to Mack. "For a team of twelve people. That's 204 forms per week, or about 10,608 forms per year. Assuming each form takes five minutes to fill out, that's 884 hours per year just filling out forms."

"Math checks out," Mack said. "So we're going to spend almost a thousand hours per year on paperwork instead of writing code."

"Exactly," Alex said. "But hey, at least we'll have great metrics to show how productive we are."

As they filed out of the conference room, Alex noticed that Michael looked more stressed than usual. The technical lead was carrying his packet like it contained radioactive material.

"Michael," Alex said, falling into step beside him. "You okay?"

Michael sighed. "I'm trying to figure out how to tell Vincent that his new agile methodology won't work with our current codebase. We have systems that haven't been updated in years, dependencies that are impossible to track, and technical debt that would make a bank manager cry."

"Good luck with that," Alex said. "I'm sure he'll be very receptive to the idea that his pet project might not work."

Michael gave him a tired smile. "Thanks for the vote of confidence."

Back at their desks, Alex opened her email and found seventeen new messages about the Digital Transformation Initiative 2.0. She deleted them all without reading them.

Alex opened her notebook and started a new page. At the top, she wrote: "Digital Transformation Initiative 2.0: A Case Study in Corporate Absurdity." Under that, she wrote: "Day 1: Seventeen forms, thirty-seven buzzwords, and one headache."

At 5:30, Alex packed up her laptop and headed for the elevator. The doors opened, but the elevator didn't move. She pressed the button again. Nothing.

The elevator was broken again.
