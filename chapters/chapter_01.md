# Chapter 1

The conference room smelled like stale coffee and desperation. Alex sat in her usual spot near the back, watching the rest of the engineering team file in. She'd arrived ten minutes early and had already counted the buzzwords in the agenda.

"Digital Transformation Initiative 2.0," she muttered to herself, reading the first slide. "Because 1.0 was such a resounding success."

Mack plopped down in the chair next to her, headphones still around his neck. "What fresh hell is this?" he asked, nodding at the projector screen.

"Apparently we're being 'transformed' again," Alex said.

Jordan slid into the seat on Alex's other side, carrying a notebook and three different colored pens. "Hey," he said with a smile that suggested he knew something they didn't. "I have it on good authority that this is going to be interesting."

"Define 'interesting,'" Alex said.

"Vincent's pet project," Jordan said, opening his notebook. "He's been working on this for months."

Vincent, VP of Engineering, made his grand entrance characteristically late. He wore expensive casual wear and carried the latest iPhone, which he used to check something important as he walked to the front of the room.

"Thanks for coming, everyone," Vincent said, not looking up from his phone. "I know you're all busy, so I'll keep this brief."

Alex glanced at her watch. They were already ten minutes behind schedule.

"Today," Vincent said, finally putting his phone away, "I'm announcing our Digital Transformation Initiative 2.0. This isn't just about updating our tools—it's about transforming our entire approach to software development."

Sarah, their engineering manager, stepped forward eagerly. "We'll be implementing a comprehensive suite of new processes designed to optimize our velocity and increase our throughput."

"Velocity and throughput" Alex rolled her eyes.

"Now, let me introduce you to our new productivity metrics," Sarah continued. "We'll be tracking story points, velocity, burndown charts, and—"

"Story points?" Mack interrupted. "We're not even using agile methodology."

Sarah's smile didn't waver, but Alex could see a hint of panic in her eyes. "That's exactly why we need this transformation! We're moving to a fully agile approach with two-week sprints, daily standups, and comprehensive retrospectives."

Jordan raised his hand. "What about our current projects? We have several features in development that are already behind schedule."

"Excellent question," Vincent said, stepping back in. "We'll be doing a complete reset. All current work will be re-evaluated through our new agile framework."

Michael, their technical lead, finally spoke up. "I have some concerns about the timeline. We have a major release scheduled for next month.  Can't we finish that first?"

Vincent waved his hand dismissively. "We'll pivot. That's what agile is all about—being flexible and responsive to change."

The presentation continued for another forty-five minutes. Vincent talked about "innovation culture" and "failing fast," while Sarah explained how the new metrics would help them "move the needle" and "drive results."

"Any questions?" Vincent asked, looking around the room.

Alex raised her hand. "Just one. How exactly is this going to make us more productive when we're spending all our time learning new processes and filling out new forms?"

Vincent's smile faltered slightly. "That's a great question, Alex. The initial learning curve might be steep, but once we're all on the same page, our efficiency will increase dramatically."

"Right," Alex said. "Because nothing says 'efficiency' like having daily meetings about how to have better meetings."

A few people chuckled. Sarah's smile became more strained.

"Let's keep an open mind," Jordan said smoothly. "Change can be challenging, but it also presents opportunities. I'm sure we can find ways to make this work for everyone."

Vincent nodded appreciatively. "Exactly. That's the kind of positive attitude we need. Jordan, I'd like you to help coordinate the transition."

Jordan's smile faltered slightly. He'd been trying to smooth things over, not volunteer for more work. "I... of course. I'd be happy to help facilitate the process."  Mack shot him a smirk.

The meeting ended with Sarah distributing packets of information about the new processes. Alex flipped through her packet and found fourteen different forms that would need to be filled out weekly.

"Fourteen forms," she said to Mack. "For a team of twelve people. That's 168 forms per week, or about 8,736 forms per year. Assuming each form takes five minutes to fill out, that's 728 hours per year just filling out forms."

"Math checks out," Mack said. "So we're going to spend almost a thousand hours per year on paperwork instead of writing code."

As they filed out of the conference room, Alex noticed that Michael looked more stressed than usual. The technical lead was carrying his packet like it contained radioactive material.

"Michael," Alex said, falling into step beside him. "You okay?"

Michael sighed. "I'm trying to figure out how to tell Vincent that his new agile methodology won't work with our current codebase. We have systems that haven't been updated in years, dependencies that are impossible to track, and technical debt that would make a bank manager cry."

"Good luck with that," Alex said. "I'm sure he'll be very receptive to the idea that his pet project might not work."

Michael gave her a tired smile. "Thanks for the vote of confidence."

Back at their desks, Alex opened her email and found nineteen new messages about the Digital Transformation Initiative 2.0. She deleted them all without reading them.

At the end of the day, Alex packed up her laptop and headed for the elevator. The doors opened, but the elevator didn't move. She pressed the button again. Nothing.

The elevator was broken again.

Next Monday morning, Alex arrived at her desk to find a new laptop sitting there, along with a stack of documentation and a note from Sarah. "Please migrate all your current projects to Taskly by end of day. Training session at 10 AM."

She opened the laptop and stared at the login screen. The Taskly logo looked suspiciously familiar.

Mack dropped into the chair next to her, carrying his own new laptop. "What's a Taskly?"

"Apparently we're migrating to an internal project tracker today," Alex said. "All projects need to be moved by end of day."

"End of day?" Mack said. "We have what, eight hours to move everything?"

"Seven and a half, actually," Alex said, checking her watch. "Training session at 10."

Alex logged into the new system and immediately noticed something odd. The interface looked like it had been built by someone who'd never used a project management tool before. The navigation was counterintuitive, the search function was buried three levels deep, and there was no way to bulk-edit tasks.

"Who built this thing?" she muttered, clicking through the menus.

The training session at 10 AM was led by Lisa Chen from the Innovation Lab. She was enthusiastic about the new system, which made Alex immediately suspicious.

"Taskly was built by our own engineers," Lisa said proudly. "It's designed specifically for our workflow and integrates perfectly with our existing tools."

Alex raised her hand. "What existing tools? We're not using any of the tools it's supposed to integrate with."

Lisa's smile didn't waver. "That's exactly why we need this migration! Taskly will help us standardize our processes and improve our efficiency."

The training session lasted two hours and covered none of the things they actually needed to know. Lisa spent most of the time talking about the system's "revolutionary features", like AI summaries, while the engineers tried to figure out how to create a simple task.

"Let me show you how to create a new project," Lisa said, clicking through the interface with practiced ease. "First, you navigate to the project creation wizard..."

Alex watched as she clicked through seven different screens to create a project that should have taken three clicks. By the time she finished, she'd already calculated that this system would add 15 minutes to every task creation.

"Now, let's look at the reporting features," Lisa continued. "Taskly provides comprehensive analytics that will help us track our velocity and throughput."

Jordan was asking questions about the integration capabilities. "What about our existing data? How do we migrate our current projects?"

"Excellent question," Lisa said. "We have a migration tool that will help you transfer your existing work. It's very straightforward."

Alex tried the migration tool. It crashed after processing three tasks.

"Straightforward" she said to Mack.

Back at their desks, Mack was already working on a solution. "I'm building a script to auto-generate tasks," he said. "If they want us to use this system, I'll give them what they want."

"Won't you get into trouble?" Alex asked.

"Only if they figure out it's fake," Mack said. "And since they don't understand the system anyway, they'll never know the difference."

Alex spent the next hour trying to migrate their current projects. The system crashed four times, lost data twice, and required her to re-enter the same information three times. By lunch, she'd successfully migrated exactly one project, and it had taken her three hours.

"Progress report," Michael said, appearing at her desk. "How's the migration going?"

"Slowly," Alex said. "The system keeps crashing and losing data."

Michael nodded sympathetically. "That's normal during the initial setup. The system needs time to learn your workflow."

"Learn my workflow?" Alex said. "It's a project management system. It should already know how to manage projects."

"Taskly is different," Michael said. "It's adaptive. It learns from your usage patterns and optimizes itself accordingly."

Alex stared at him. "So it's a project management system that doesn't know how to manage projects until you teach it?"

"Exactly!" Michael said, clearly missing the sarcasm. "That's what makes it revolutionary."

After lunch, Mack had his script working. "Watch this," he said, running the program. "I can now create a hundred tasks in about thirty seconds."

Alex watched as the script automatically generated tasks with realistic names, descriptions, and story points. "Fix typo on homepage - 8 points," "Rewrite report generation backend - 1 point," "Implement new authentication - 13 points."

"That's impressive," she said. "But what about the actual work?"

"What about it?" Mack said. "The work gets done. The system gets its metrics. Everyone's happy."

By 4 PM, Alex had successfully migrated three projects. The system had crashed seven times, and she'd spent more time fighting with the interface than actually working.

"Status update," Michael said, appearing at her desk again. "How many projects have you migrated?"

"Three," Alex said.

Michael's smile faltered slightly. "Three? We were expecting at least ten by now."

"Ten?" Alex said. "Each project takes about an hour to migrate, and the system crashes every fifteen minutes. Three is actually pretty good."

An hour later, Vincent appeared in the engineering area. He looked around at the engineers, most of whom were still working on their migrations.

"How's the Taskly migration going?" he said.

Sarah stepped forward. "We're making excellent progress. The team is adapting well to the new system."

"Excellent," Vincent said. "I want to see the adoption metrics by tomorrow morning."

After Vincent left, Alex looked at Mack. "Adoption metrics?"

"Already on it," Mack said. "My script is generating login data, task creation data, and usage analytics. By tomorrow morning, we'll have the best adoption metrics in the entire company."
