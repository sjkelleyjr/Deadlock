# Chapter 1

Alex arrived at the conference room ten minutes early, which meant he was the last one there. The table was already surrounded by engineers clutching their laptops like security blankets. He found a seat in the back corner, next to the window that overlooked the parking garage.

Marcus was already there, typing something on his phone. He looked up when Alex sat down. "You see the email from HR about the new dress code?"

Alex hadn't. "What dress code?"

"The one that doesn't exist yet, but they're thinking about implementing. They sent a survey asking if we'd be more productive in business casual or if we should stick with 'whatever makes us comfortable.'"

"Jesus Christ."

"Exactly. They're literally asking us to vote on whether we should have to wear pants."

Jordan slid into the chair on Alex's other side. He was carrying a notebook and three different colored pens. "What are we voting on?"

"Pants," Alex said.

The room was filling up. Sarah from Engineering was setting up her laptop at the front of the table. She had that look people get when they're about to present something they know everyone will hate. Alex had seen it before. It was the same look people get when they're about to announce that the office is going open-plan.

Michael, their technical lead, was making his way around the table, shaking hands with people he saw every day. He was wearing a shirt that was trying very hard to be casual while still being professional. It was failing at both.

"All right, everyone," Sarah said. "Thanks for coming. I know this is short notice, but we have some important updates about our development process."

Alex opened his laptop and started checking his email. He'd learned long ago that the best way to survive these meetings was to look busy while actually doing something useful.

"First, I want to talk about our current sprint velocity," Sarah said. "We're averaging about sixty-seven percent of our target."

Jordan raised his hand. "How are we calculating that target?"

"Good question. We're using story points completed divided by story points planned, adjusted for complexity factors."

"What are the complexity factors?"

Sarah clicked to the next slide. "Well, that's what we're here to discuss. We've been using a three-point scale, but management thinks we should move to a five-point scale to get more granular."

Marcus leaned over to Alex. "Five points. That's new."

"Give it time," Alex whispered. "She's just getting started."

"Now, the reason we're moving to five points is that our current system doesn't account for the time we spend in meetings about the sprint planning process itself. With the new system, we'll be able to track how much time we spend planning versus how much time we spend actually building features."

Alex looked up from his laptop. "So we're going to spend more time tracking how much time we spend in meetings about tracking time?"

"Exactly," Sarah said, missing the sarcasm entirely. "This will give us better visibility into our actual productivity."

Jordan was taking notes. "And how will this affect our quarterly goals?"

"Great question. We're also implementing a new performance review system that will evaluate each team member on their contribution to our velocity metrics."

Marcus raised his hand. "What if someone spends a lot of time helping other team members? Does that count toward their velocity?"

Sarah smiled. "That's exactly the kind of question we're hoping to answer with this new system. We're calling it the Collaborative Efficiency Index."

Alex closed his laptop. "So we're being evaluated on how well we perform on metrics that may or may not measure actual performance, and the solution is to add more metrics?"

"Not more metrics," Sarah said. "Better metrics. More granular metrics."

"Right," Alex said. "More granular metrics about metrics."

The room was quiet. Sarah clicked to the next slide. "Now, the exciting part. We're also introducing mandatory innovation time. Every Friday afternoon, you'll have two hours to work on innovative projects that could benefit the company."

Jordan raised his hand again. "Will this innovation time count toward our velocity metrics?"

"Of course not," Sarah said. "Innovation time is separate from regular development work."

"So we're being evaluated on metrics that don't include the time we're supposed to spend being innovative," Alex said.

Sarah's smile was starting to look strained. "The goal is to balance productivity with innovation."

Sarah ignored him and moved to her conclusion. "I know this represents a significant change, but I'm confident that with your cooperation, we can achieve our goals. Any questions?"

The room was silent. Not because there were no questions, but because everyone knew the questions wouldn't be answered.

"Excellent," Sarah said. "I'll be scheduling individual meetings with each team to discuss implementation details. Thank you for your attention."

As the room began to empty, the three engineers stayed in their seats.

"Well," Marcus said, "that was... something."

"Something being the operative word," Alex said.

Jordan was already pulling out his phone. "I'm going to schedule a meeting with Sarah to discuss the implementation timeline."

"Good luck with that," Michael said, turning around again. "I've been trying to get a meeting with her for three weeks."

As they filed out of the conference room, Alex looked at his teammates. "So. Five-point story points. Anyone want to place bets on how long this lasts?"

"Three months," Marcus said. "Maximum."

"Six," Jordan said. "They'll give it a full quarter before they realize it's not working."

"Eight," Alex said. "Because by then they'll have invested too much to admit it was a mistake."

Michael sighed. "I hate that you're probably right."

As they walked back to their desks, Jordan was already typing on his phone. "I'm setting up a meeting with Sarah for tomorrow. I'll see if I can negotiate some reasonable exceptions to these new rules."

"Good luck with that," Marcus said. "But don't get your hopes up."

"Never do," Jordan said with a grin. "But that doesn't mean I won't try."

Alex sat down at his desk and opened his email. There was already a calendar invite from Sarah for a "Sprint Velocity Optimization Planning Session" next week.
