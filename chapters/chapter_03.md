# Chapter 3

Alex's apartment was exactly what you'd expect from someone who spent most of her time at work. The living room was dominated by a large desk with three monitors, a mechanical keyboard, and a collection of coffee mugs from failed startups. The walls were bare except for a single poster of a circuit board that she'd found at a tech conference five years ago.

But in the corner, almost hidden behind a stack of technical books, was her guitar.

It was a vintage Fender Stratocaster that she'd bought with her first real paycheck. The case was dusty, and the strings were probably out of tune, but she still picked it up sometimes when she couldn't sleep.

Tonight was one of those nights.

She'd been lying in bed for two hours, thinking about the Taskly migration and the nineteen forms she'd have to fill out tomorrow. Her brain wouldn't shut off, cycling through the same thoughts: the system crashes, the fake metrics, the way Vincent had looked at her when she'd asked about productivity.

She got up, made herself a cup of tea, and sat down on the couch with her guitar. The strings were indeed out of tune, but she didn't mind. Tuning was part of the ritual, a way to focus on something that wasn't work.

As she turned the tuning pegs, she thought about her college band. They'd been terrible, but they'd had fun. They'd played covers of songs they barely knew, and somehow managed to get a few gigs at local bars. She'd been the rhythm guitarist, which meant she'd mostly played power chords and tried not to mess up the timing.

Her phone buzzed with a text from her college roommate, Rachel. "Still alive?"

Alex smiled. Rachel was now a professor at a small liberal arts college in Vermont, and they still talked regularly. Rachel was the only person who knew about her guitar, about the band, about the version of herself that had existed before she'd become a corporate drone.

"Barely," Alex replied. "How's academic life?"

"Grading papers. You know how it is."

Alex did know. Rachel had her own version of corporate absurdity - department politics, grant applications, the pressure to publish. But at least Rachel got to teach students who actually wanted to learn, who asked questions because they were curious, not because they were trying to look smart in front of their manager.

She started playing a simple chord progression, something she'd written years ago. It wasn't good, but it didn't matter. The melody was melancholy, which felt appropriate.

Her cat, Pixel, wandered into the room and jumped up on the couch next to her. Pixel was a rescue cat who'd been found living in the server room of her previous company. She'd adopted him when the company went under, and he'd been with her ever since. He was the only living thing that didn't expect anything from her.

"Hey, buddy," she said, scratching behind his ears. "How's it going?"

Pixel purred and settled down next to her, watching her fingers move across the fretboard. He was used to this routine - Alex playing guitar late at night when she couldn't sleep, when work was too much to process.

She thought about the barista at her coffee shop. His name was Jake, and he was probably in his early twenties. He had a tattoo of a guitar on his forearm, and she'd overheard him talking about his band The Yahoos to another customer. They were playing a show next weekend at The Basement.

She'd thought about asking him about it, about telling him that she used to play too. But she was thirty-two, and he was probably twenty-three, and the idea of explaining her corporate job to someone who spent his days making coffee and his nights playing music felt impossible.

Besides, what would she say? "I used to be in a band, but now I spend my days fighting with project management software and generating fake metrics for executives who don't understand what I do"?

She put the guitar down and picked up her phone. Rachel had sent another text: "Remember when we used to talk about changing the world?"

Alex laughed. They had talked about that, back in college. Rachel was going to revolutionize education, and Alex was going to build software that actually helped people. They'd been so sure that they could make a difference, that they could avoid the corporate machine that had consumed their parents.

Alex looked around her apartment. It was clean, organized, and completely devoid of personality. The furniture was functional, the decorations were minimal, and the only personal touches were the guitar and the cat. It looked like a hotel room that someone had lived in for too long.

She thought about her parents, who'd worked for the same company for thirty years. They'd been good people, hard workers, but they'd never seemed particularly happy. They'd talked about retirement like it was some kind of reward for surviving decades of corporate life, like the goal was to get through it rather than to enjoy it.

Was that what she was doing? Just getting through it?

She picked up the guitar again and started playing a different song, something by a band she'd loved in college. She couldn't remember all the words, so she made up her own.

Pixel looked up at her, his ears twitching.

"Sorry, buddy," she said. "I know that's not very rock and roll."

She put the guitar down and checked the time. It was almost midnight, and she had to be at work at 8:30 tomorrow. She should probably try to get some sleep.

But instead, she opened her laptop and started writing. She wasn't sure what she was writing - maybe a blog post, maybe a letter to herself, maybe just thoughts that needed to get out of her head.

"Dear Future Alex," she typed. "If you're reading this, it means you're still alive and still working at ByteSauce. I hope you're doing okay. I hope you haven't forgotten about the guitar in the corner, or the person you used to be."

She paused, thinking about what else to write.

"I hope you remember that you're not just a cog in the machine, even if it feels like that sometimes. I hope you remember that you're still capable of creating something, even if it's just a simple chord progression on a guitar that's slightly out of tune."

She saved the file and closed her laptop. Pixel was still sitting next to her, watching her with his green eyes.

She put the guitar back in its case and carried it to the corner where it lived. As she was putting it away, she noticed a business card that had fallen behind the case. It was from a local music store, advertising guitar lessons.

She'd picked it up months ago, thinking maybe she'd take lessons again, maybe she'd get better, maybe she'd find a way to make music a bigger part of her life. But she'd never called the number, never made the time.

She put the card back where she'd found it and went to bed. Tomorrow she would punch another ticket to the corporate carnival, fight with systems that didn't work, generate reports that no one would read. But tonight, for a little while, she'd remembered who she used to be.
