# Chapter 15

David from HR arrived at his desk in the morning. He hung his coat on the back of his chair and straightened the motivational posters on his cubicle walls. "Excellence is not a skill, it's an attitude," read one. "Success is the sum of small efforts repeated daily," proclaimed another. His favorite, positioned directly across from his chair, simply said "PROCESS" in bold red letters.

He opened his laptop and checked his calendar. Today was investigation day. He had interviews scheduled with the entire engineering team, starting with Alex at 9:30 AM. David felt a familiar sense of purpose as he reviewed his prepared questions and checklist. HR investigations were his specialty—he had conducted over fifty in the past three years, and he prided himself on his thoroughness and objectivity.

At 9:25 AM, David gathered his clipboard and walked toward Alex's desk. He passed by the engineering area, noting the casual atmosphere—hoodies, coffee cups, the faint sound of typing. It was so different from the HR floor, where everyone wore business casual and spoke in measured tones.

"Alex, I need to speak with you about some concerns that have been raised," David announced, appearing at her desk with his practiced professional smile.

Alex glanced at her screen, then back at David. "What kind of concerns?"

David opened his clipboard and began reading from his prepared statement. "The engineering team has been accused of three primary violations: resisting corporate initiatives, creating a negative work environment, and failing to collaborate effectively."

Alex blinked. "Who made these accusations?"

"Anonymous complaints," David responded simply. "Standard procedure requires investigation regardless of source."

Alex leaned back in her chair. "So you're investigating us based on anonymous complaints about not being excited enough about broken systems?"

David's smile remained fixed. "I'm investigating the allegations as presented. The first concern is that the team shows insufficient enthusiasm for company initiatives."

"Which initiatives?"

"Taskly migration, the new collaboration framework, vendor platform implementation."

Alex nodded slowly. "And the second accusation?"

"Creating a negative work environment through excessive questioning and challenging management decisions."

"By asking questions and pointing out problems?"

David's pen moved across his clipboard. "The third concern is lack of participation in mandatory collaboration activities."

Alex stared at him. "What mandatory activities?"

"Daily check-ins, pair programming sessions, collaborative performance metrics."

Alex couldn't help herself. "You mean the activities that waste time and don't help us do our work?"

David's expression didn't change. "I'm documenting the team's response to these concerns. How would you characterize the team's attitude toward these initiatives?"

Alex considered for a moment. "Honest. We point out when things don't work and ask questions when decisions don't make sense."

David wrote this down. "And how often does this occur?"

"Whenever we're asked to implement something that doesn't work or doesn't make sense."

David nodded and continued writing. "How does the team respond when management explains the benefits of these initiatives?"

"By pointing out that the benefits don't materialize and the systems still don't work."

David's pen paused. "And how does management respond to this?"

"They tell us to give it more time and learn to use it properly."

David looked up from his clipboard. "I see. And how does the team feel about the mandatory collaboration activities?"

"We don't participate in activities that waste our time and don't help us do our work."

David wrote this down. "I think I have sufficient information for now. This investigation will take approximately two weeks to complete."

"Two weeks to investigate complaints about not being excited enough about broken systems?"

David's smile remained unchanged. "I have a procedure to follow. I'll be interviewing all team members and preparing a comprehensive report."

Alex watched as David stood and walked toward Mack's desk, clipboard in hand. She could hear him beginning the same prepared statement.

David conducted his interviews throughout the morning, moving from desk to desk with the same practiced professionalism. Each engineer gave similar responses—they questioned inefficiencies, pointed out problems, and generally avoided activities that felt like a waste of time. David documented everything meticulously, his pen moving across page after page of his legal pad.

At noon, David returned to his cubicle and reviewed his notes. The pattern was clear: the engineering team consistently challenged corporate initiatives and expressed frustration with systems that didn't work. He began drafting his preliminary findings, using the standard HR template he had developed over the years.

"Subject: Preliminary Investigation Findings - Engineering Team
Date: [Current Date]
Investigator: David Merkle, HR Specialist

Executive Summary:
The investigation into allegations against the engineering team has revealed recurring behaviors that may require intervention..."

David paused, considering his next sentence. He had learned early in his HR career that the key to successful investigations was maintaining objectivity while following established procedures. He had handled everything from dress code disputes to workplace harassment, and he prided himself on his ability to remain impartial.

He continued writing, detailing each allegation and the team's responses. The procedure was familiar—he had done this many times before. The engineers' answers were straightforward, sometimes blunt, always rooted in what worked. David had seen this before: technical people who valued results over rituals.

At 2:30 PM, David took a break and walked to the break room for coffee. He passed by the engineering area again, noting the contrast with his own department. The engineers worked in an open space with standing desks and whiteboards covered in diagrams. His HR colleagues worked in cubicles with motivational posters and filing cabinets.

David poured himself a cup of coffee and thought about his family. His wife Gwen also worked in HR at a different company, and they had two children—Maya, age 8, and Lucas, age 5. Gwen often joked that David brought his HR personality home with him, always asking the children to "follow the process" when they got into arguments.

"Dad, Maya took my toy!" Lucas would whine.
"Let's follow the conflict resolution process," David would respond. "First, we need to identify the issue. Second, we need to understand both perspectives..."

Gwen would roll her eyes and say, "David, they're five and eight. Just tell them to share."

But David believed in the power of procedure. It was the backbone of his professional life, a safeguard against disorder.

He returned to his desk and continued working on his investigation report. The afternoon passed quickly as he interviewed the remaining team members and compiled his findings. Each interview followed the same pattern—he would read the allegations, the engineer would provide their perspective, and he would document everything for his report.

By 5:30 PM, David had completed all his interviews. He closed his laptop and gathered his materials. The investigation was proceeding according to schedule. He would spend the next few days compiling his final report, which would include recommendations for management action.

As he walked to his car, David reflected on his day. The engineers were pragmatic, always questioning inefficiencies and voicing their frustrations with broken systems. But David's responsibility ended with the report; what happened next was out of his hands.

At home, Gwen was preparing dinner while the children played in the living room. Maya was building a tower with blocks, and Lucas was trying to knock it down.

"Dad's home!" Lucas shouted, running to greet David.

"Hi, buddy," David greeted, hugging his son. "How was your day?"

"Maya won't share the blocks!"

David looked at his wife, who was watching from the kitchen with an amused expression. "Let's follow the conflict resolution process," David began.

Gwen interrupted. "David, just tell them to take turns. They're kids, not employees."

David smiled. "You're right. Lucas, Maya, let's take turns with the blocks. Maya, you can build for five minutes, then Lucas gets a turn."

The children agreed, and David joined his family for dinner. Over the meal, Gwen asked about his day.

"Just another investigation," David reported. "The engineering team is being investigated for not being enthusiastic enough about corporate initiatives."

Gwen raised an eyebrow. "What does that mean?"

"Anonymous complaints about their attitude toward company projects."

"And what did you find?"

David considered his response. "They're practical. If something doesn't work, they say so."

Gwen nodded. "So they're being investigated for being good at their jobs?"

David thought about this. "I'm investigating the allegations as presented. The decision about action will be made by management."

Gwen smiled. "David, sometimes I think you're too good at following 'the process'."

David looked at his wife. "Procedure is what keeps things running smoothly."

Gwen laughed. "Procedure also makes you sound like a robot sometimes."

David smiled. "I prefer to think of it as professional consistency."

"Taken too far, it can make life awfully boring."

After dinner, David helped put the children to bed, then returned to his home office to work on his investigation report. He opened his laptop and began typing:

"Final Investigation Report - Engineering Team
Date: [Current Date]
Investigator: David Merkle, HR Specialist

Executive Summary:
The investigation into allegations against the engineering team has been completed. All team members were interviewed, and their responses have been documented..."

David worked methodically, following the standard HR report template he had used for years. The report would be thorough, objective, and professional. It would include all relevant information and provide clear recommendations for management action.

As he typed, David thought about the engineering team's responses. Their answers were direct, sometimes blunt, and always focused on what worked.

But his role was to document, not to judge. He gathered the facts, wrote the findings, and left the consequences to others.
