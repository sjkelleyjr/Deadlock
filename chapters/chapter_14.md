# Chapter 14

Bradley from OptiMax arrived at 1:47 PM, early enough to rearrange the room. He tilted the screen, swapped the HDMI cable for his own, and set a branded water bottle at a precise forty-five-degree angle next to his laptop. Aisha, his solutions architect, lined up three adapters like surgical tools and asked for the guest Wi‑Fi with a smile that had been practiced in a hundred lobbies.

Sarah was already there, smoothing the handouts that no one would read. She’d blocked ninety minutes for the session and booked the only conference room with a door that actually latched.

Alex took a seat near the back with her notebook open to a blank page. Mack sat beside her and started a quiet inventory of the dongles, whispering model numbers under his breath. Jordan chose the middle of the table where he could see the deck and the faces at the same time.

Vincent walked in last and didn’t take off his sunglasses until the lights dimmed.

“Thanks for coming in,” Sarah said, and gestured toward the screen like a stage manager. “Let’s keep this focused on how your platform can help our immediate needs.”

Bradley clicked to a title slide that had more gradients than information. “Absolutely. OptiMax provides a unified observability fabric with AI-assisted incident triage, zero-touch scaling, and compliance-first data controls. You’ll see faster time-to-diagnosis, fewer midnight pages, and happier engineers.”

Mack whispered, “Happier engineers is a feature?”

Alex didn’t smile. “It’s in the enterprise tier.”

The demo launched into a dashboard with gauges, dials, and a map of the world for no apparent reason. Colored lines pulsed across graphs that measured something that might have been throughput or might have been confidence.

“This is our Command Canvas,” Bradley said. “One pane of glass. Instead of six tools, one experience. Our customers typically deprecate three vendors in the first quarter.”

Vincent leaned forward. “What’s your time-to-value?”

“Day one, you’ll see insights,” Bradley said. “Day thirty, you’ll wonder how you lived without us.”

Aisha advanced to a screen labeled Policy Studio. “Data residency is configured here. We support regional pinning, retention windows, and field-level masking. SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI—we’ve got standard mappings out of the box.”

Jordan raised a hand. “How do you handle export controls for mixed-jurisdiction datasets?”

“Automatic segmentation using tags,” Aisha said. “No developer effort.”

“What’s the API surface area?” she asked. “Webhooks, rate limits, auth, pagination strategy?”

“Full REST and GraphQL,” Aisha said smoothly. “Unlimited rate for trusted partners, OAuth 2.1, cursor-based pagination.”

“Documentation?” Alex said.

“Best-in-class,” Bradley said. “Developer love is our north star.”

Mack tilted his head. “Can the agent run air-gapped?”

“We have a hybrid story,” Bradley said. “Edge collectors, centralized intelligence.”



Sarah nodded at the slide with the customer logos. A handful were recognizable. A few were aspirational. One was their competitor.

“Let’s talk about the present,” Sarah said. “Our monitoring is fragmented. We need clarity without another migration that burns a quarter.”

“Perfect,” Bradley said. “Our Seamless Lift assists ingestion from legacy systems. We don’t migrate, we harmonize.”

Jordan tracked the phrasing and filed it in his mind under “useful if the pitch needs selling upward.”

Vincent tapped the table. “We need to look bold to the board next month. Can you stand up a proof in two weeks?”

“We love quick wins,” Bradley said. “We can do a pilot with three services. Success criteria aligned to incident reduction and signal fidelity.”

Sarah exhaled like a decision had moved an inch closer to being inevitable. “Scope it. Define ingest boundaries. No production writes.”

“Of course,” Bradley said. “Read-only to start.”

He dragged an artificial incident into view. The dashboard lit up with a red banner that read something between urgent and theatrical. A bot posted a recommendation in a side panel: suspected saturation in pool X, probable cause Y, suggested action Z.

“Our Copilot analyzes eleven dimensions,” Aisha said. “It’s not rule-based—it learns your environment.”

“From what data?” Alex asked.

“Trace, metrics, logs,” Aisha said. “Plus meta-signals.”

“Define meta-signals,” Alex said.

“Context across correlated streams,” Aisha said. “We can share the whitepaper.”

Mack murmured, “Translation: vibes.”

Jordan cut in before the mood curdled. “Permissions model?”

“Role-based with project scoping,” Aisha said. “SAML, SCIM. Least privilege enforced.”

Vincent pointed at the graph that was trending upward in an encouraging color. “If this halves incidents, I’ll sign today.”

Bradley smiled like the deal memo had just written itself. “Let’s walk through commercials after we wow you.”

Commercials arrived anyway. Seat-based pricing for features that sounded like adjectives. A surcharge for “advanced retention.” A discount if they cut their current contracts within sixty days.

Sarah’s pen paused. “We’re not cutting anything without evidence. Pilot first.”

Jordan added, “And the pilot is no-cost.”

Bradley hesitated. “We can do a token fee to cover enablement.”

“No-cost,” Jordan repeated. He did not smile.

Vincent waved it along. “Send your paper; we’ll get legal to bless it.”

Aisha advanced to a slide titled Integration Path. “Install lightweight collectors. Configure service tags. Point your exporters here.” She circled a URL that was vaguely reassuring.

Mack glanced at Alex. “Want to see how it handles honest data?”

“After,” Alex said, never looking away from the screen.

They made it to the live portion. Bradley asked for a sample log stream; Mack provided one. It was a sanitized feed from a noisy service: intermittent timeouts, occasional spikes, a few Unicode surprises.

The dashboard consumed the feed, thought, and produced a sentence that would have been useful if it had been correct.

“We’re seeing memory pressure,” Bradley said. “Recommendation: increase heap by twenty-five percent.”

“That service is running with a generous heap,” Alex said. “The bottleneck is upstream retries after a partial deploy. We pinched the wrong lane last week.”

Aisha frowned. “The model will learn.”

“How long does learning take?” Alex asked.

“Depends on entropy,” Aisha said.

Mack coughed into his fist. “Entropy is high today.”

Bradley recovered. “That’s why we do a pilot—to tune to your reality.”

Jordan flipped his notebook to a page titled Nothing That Sounds Like A Promise. “Let’s outline success: a reduction in false positives, accurate root cause suggestions on at least two live incidents, and no data leaving region without explicit approval.”

Sarah nodded. “Also: minimal engineering lift. We’re already underwater.”

“Understood,” Bradley said. “Our team will do the heavy lifting.”

“With our SREs supervising,” Jordan added.

Vincent stood. “If we get lift from this, we roll it out. I want momentum.”

The pitch wrapped with a video of another customer congratulating the platform in a voiceover that could have sold luxury SUVs.

When the lights came up, Sarah started moving chairs back where they belonged. Bradley produced a clipboard for signatures that weren’t required yet.

“We’ll send the pilot doc,” he said. “You’ll have it tonight.”

“Tomorrow,” Jordan said. “Tonight we have real work.”

Bradley’s smile thinned. “Tomorrow morning, first thing.”

They left a stack of glossy one-pagers and two pastel stress balls shaped like clouds.

Vincent left first. “Two weeks,” he said to the room, to the air, to the calendar. “Make it shine.”

Sarah looked at Jordan. “You’ll coordinate the pilot.” It came out less like a question than a law of physics.

Jordan’s smile edged. “Of course.”

“Alex,” Sarah said, “own evaluation criteria. Document everything.”

Alex nodded.

“Mack,” Sarah said, “wire the collectors. Contain the blast radius.”

Mack saluted with a stress cloud.

They waited until the hallway noise faded before saying anything that sounded like opinions.

“Their model thinks in slogans,” Mack said.

“It thinks in correlations,” Alex said. “Slogans are the interface.”

Jordan flipped to a new page. “If we control the criteria, the pilot stays honest. We can live with a tool that’s noisy as long as we can mute it.”

“Or we become the tool that tunes their product for free,” Mack said.

Alex started a list labeled "Things That Will Break". She wrote: rate limits, tag drift, Unicode, traffic spikes that look like holidays, dashboards that forget time zones, alerts that page security instead of ops, agents that update themselves at 2 AM.

Jordan added a second list: People Who Will Ask For Demos. He wrote three names and then crossed out one.

Sarah stepped back in with Michael behind her. “Quick sync. Pilot goes forward. Keep it isolated. If legal complains, we pause.”

Michael scanned the remnants on the table—glossy clouds, abandoned adapters, a printed slide that read Operational Nirvana. “What’s the catch?”

“Seat pricing,” Jordan said. “And a surcharge for remembering things longer than a month.”

“We can’t even remember things for a week,” Michael said. “Maybe we’re safe.”

Sarah kept moving. “Jordan, set cadences. Daily check-in during pilot. Thirty minutes. Keep it light.”

“I’ll loop in legal for the data path,” Sarah said. “No surprises.”

They dispersed with assignments that felt like sand poured into the gaps of their day.

The first install happened in a staging cluster after dinner. Mack opened the readme and stopped at a line that assumed root and optimism. He wrote a wrapper, built a container that refused to call home without a signed note, and labeled every outbound request with a fluorescent tag.

“You’re tracing the tracer,” Alex said.

“If it blinks, I want to know,” Mack said. “Also if it blinks when no one asked it to.”

He fed the agent a sample of logs they didn’t mind sharing with strangers. The collector accepted the offering, translated it into its own taxonomy, and drew a graph that ignored reality in an attractive way.

Alex opened a terminal and produced an incident on purpose: a locked mutex in a sidecar that usually behaved itself. The dashboard lit up late and guessed wrong again.

“Entropy still high,” Mack said.

“It will adjust,” Alex said. “Or we will.”

She wrote a short script that mapped their internal labels to the vendor’s tags, added the ones that mattered, and blackholed the ones that didn’t. She left comments that would make sense to her in a month.

Jordan drafted the pilot document. He avoided adjectives and used numbers where a fight might happen. He added a table: date, incident, platform suggestion, actual root cause, helpful/not helpful, notes. He left the last column blank and titled it Evidence.

At 9:20 PM, the vendor Slack lit up with a cheerful message from someone named Nate offering to hop on a quick call to help them “accelerate success.” Jordan replied with a screenshot of the table and “We’ll add to this tomorrow,” then muted the channel for eight hours.

—

By the second day, the agent had stopped trying to phone unfamiliar regions. By the third, the suggestions were less wrong and more vague. On the fourth, the platform correctly identified a slow database connection and suggested increasing the connection pool by exactly zero, which was an impressive hedge.

“They’re learning,” Mack said. “How to avoid being wrong in public.”

“A valuable skill,” Jordan said.

Sarah forwarded a note from Vincent with three words: Board wants wins.

Alex added a new row to the table: midnight deploy, noisy alarms, wrong owner auto-paged; platform suggestion: adjust alert threshold; actual root cause: test flag persisting to prod after rollback. Helpful: no.

Jordan kept the table clean and the language clean and the edges clean because the outcome would not be.

Legal returned the pilot agreement with two clauses highlighted and one crossed out. Data stayed put. Metrics anonymized. Incident details redacted before any “training” occurred. Aisha accepted all changes and replied with a smile emoji and a calendar invite titled Enablement Workshop that landed on top of something that was supposed to matter more.

Michael stopped by their desks and looked at the graph wall. “Is it helping?”

“It’s not hurting,” Alex said.

“Except the part where it wants an owner for the ‘happiness score,’” Mack said. “I’m not volunteering.”

“Jordan already did,” Alex said.

Jordan didn’t look up. “I volunteered to make sure no one else had to.”

On the last day of the second week, Bradley returned with a summary deck titled Outcomes. He clicked through charts that presented their table in radiant colors. The misfires were footnotes; the maybes were testimonials.

“We saw a twenty-three percent reduction in mean detection time,” Bradley said. “We improved signal efficiency by forty.”

“From what baseline?” Alex asked.

“Industry baseline,” Bradley said.

“Whose industry?” Mack asked.

“Leaders like you,” Bradley said.

Jordan slid the data table printout across the conference table. “Two correct nudges, five unhelpful guesses, four times we were told to ‘monitor closely.’ That’s not a case study.”

Bradley nodded gravely. “Pilots are for learning. With a full rollout, you’d unlock features that change the slope.”

Vincent appeared in the doorway as if summoned by the word slope. “Can we claim the improvement?”

“We can claim we measured things,” Jordan said.

Sarah folded the glossy one-pager in half. “We’re not ripping anything out yet. We’ll keep the pilot where it is and revisit next quarter. No more seats. No production breadcrumbs. If it earns its place, it stays.”

He reset his smile. “We’ll be here when you’re ready.”

He packed the adapters, lined up the water bottle, and left two more clouds.

After they left, the room felt louder without actual sound. The screen reflected a quiet desktop and Jordan’s table in grayscale.

Mack tossed a stress cloud in the air and caught it with one hand. “External pressure applied; internal pressure unchanged.”

“Correction,” Alex said. “Internal pressure redistributed.”

Jordan looked at his calendar. A new rectangle had appeared while Bradley was talking. It was blue, it was daily, it was early, and it had his name next to Host.

He clicked it open: Pilot Standup — 8:15.

He moved it to 8:30 and didn’t add a reason.
