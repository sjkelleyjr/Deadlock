# Chapter 10

The email arrived on a Tuesday morning, just as Alex was settling into her desk. The subject line read “MANDATORY: Team Building Exercise - This Friday.” She opened it with the same enthusiasm she reserved for reading the terms and conditions on a software update.

“Collaborative activities.” “Strengthen our bonds.” “Bring your enthusiasm.” Alex considered faking a dental emergency that day.

Mack appeared at her desk, eyes wide. “You get the team building email too?”

Jordan joined them, already plotting. “I say we treat this like a hackathon. But for chaos.”

Friday came and the team shuffled into the conference room.

The exercise facilitators, Sarah and Jennifer, beamed at the group. “Let’s start with the Human Knot activity!”

The engineers formed a circle. But instead of grabbing hands, they started arguing about optimal knot topology.

“Is this a Hamiltonian path or an Eulerian circuit?” Alex asked.

Mack, arms folded, declared, “I refuse to participate in a non-deterministic knot.”

Jordan began drawing graphs on the whiteboard. Within minutes, the group had split into two camps: those who wanted to simulate the knot in Python, and those who wanted to brute-force it with a Monte Carlo method. No one moved. The facilitators, flustered, called time and moved on to the next activity.

Each team received spaghetti, tape, string, and a marshmallow.  The goal of the activity was to construct a structure that put the marshallow as high off the ground as possible.

Mack immediately began stress-testing the spaghetti, snapping pieces and muttering, “Brittle failure at 0.2 newtons.”

Alex built a cantilever bridge that collapsed under the weight of a single marshmallow. Jordan constructed a spaghetti “tower” that was technically a Möbius strip.

At one point, the engineers started trading materials with other teams, forming a black market for tape and string. Someone tried to 3D print a marshmallow. The facilitators, overwhelmed once again, declared everyone a winner and decided to move on to the last activity.

The final activity was called "The Communication Challenge." Each person was given a piece of paper with instructions that they couldn't show to anyone else. They had to work together to complete a task without speaking.

The engineers took this as a challenge to invent a new language. Mack began communicating in Morse code by tapping his water bottle. Alex started using interpretive dance to indicate “move the box.” Jordan, not to be outdone, began making bird calls.

Soon, the room devolved into a cacophony of clapping, stomping, and what sounded suspiciously like the opening bars of “Stayin’ Alive.” Someone started the wave. Another engineer began moonwalking. The facilitators, desperate, tried to regain control, but the engineers had already formed a conga line.

Mack, grinning, cranked up the conference room speakers and blasted disco. The entire engineering team—plus a few curious onlookers—danced their way out of the room, arms flailing, bird calls echoing, and spaghetti towers waving like flags.

As they collapsed at their desks, Alex said, “Well, we definitely improved communication. I think I just told Jordan to deploy to production using only jazz hands.”

Mack nodded. “And I negotiated a code freeze with interpretive tap dance.”

Jordan, still out of breath, said, “Best team building ever.”

Somewhere, faintly, disco music played on.
