# Chapter 11

Alex was having a terrible morning. Her coffee machine had broken, her cat had knocked over her vintage computer collection, and now Vincent was standing in the middle of the office, clapping his hands like a kindergarten teacher.

"Everyone! Everyone, listen up!" Vincent boomed. "We have an urgent budget meeting in the main conference room at 10 AM. All hands required. This is not optional."

Alex stared at her broken coffee machine and wondered if there was a way for her to get out of this.

Jordan joined her and Mack, already scrolling through his phone. "I've been reading about corporate budget meetings. Apparently, they're supposed to be 'collaborative' and 'transparent.'"

Alex snorted. "Right."

The meeting was scheduled for 10 AM in the main conference room. By 9:55, the room was packed with engineers, managers, and various middle-management types who looked like they'd rather be anywhere else. Vincent was already at the front of the room, pacing back and forth like a caged tiger.

"Good morning, everyone!" Vincent boomed. "Today we're going to discuss our budget for the next quarter. As you all know, we're facing some challenges in the market, and we need to be more efficient with our resources."

Alex leaned over to Mack. "Translation: We're cutting your budget and expecting more work."

Vincent continued. "We need to increase our feature output by 50% while reducing our budget by 25%. This is a challenge, but I know we can rise to it."

The room went silent. Then, slowly, the engineers began to exchange glances. This wasn't going to be a normal budget meeting.

Jordan was the first to speak. "That's an interesting challenge, Vincent. Could you clarify what you mean by 'feature output'?"

Vincent looked pleased that someone was engaging. "Well, we need to deliver more features to our customers. More value, more innovation, more disruption."

Mack raised his hand. "So, if I understand correctly, you want us to do 50% more work with 25% less money?"

"Exactly!" Vincent said, clearly missing the sarcasm.

Alex couldn't help herself. "That's mathematically impossible."

Vincent frowned. "Nothing is impossible if you think outside the box.  Frugality breeds innovative!"

Mack grinned. "Oh, I love thinking outside the box. Let me propose a solution."

The engineers leaned forward. This was going to be good.

"Instead of trying to do more with less," Mack said, "what if we did less with more?"

Vincent looked confused. "What do you mean?"

"Well," Mack continued, "if we increase our budget by 50% and reduce our feature output by 25%, we'll have more resources for proper testing, documentation, and technical debt reduction. That way we can build a more sustainable foundation for future growth. Quality over quantity, right?"

The room erupted in laughter. Even some of the managers were trying to hide their smiles.

Vincent's face turned red. "That's not what I meant."

Jordan stepped in smoothly. "I think what Mack is saying is that we need to be more strategic about our approach. Maybe we could focus on the features that provide the most value to our customers."

"Exactly!" Vincent said, relieved to have someone on his side.

Alex raised her hand. "So, which features provide the most value?"

Vincent looked around the room. "Well, that's what we need to figure out."

Mack nodded. "Great! Let's start by defining what 'value' means. Is it revenue? User engagement? Customer satisfaction? Technical debt reduction?"

Vincent was starting to look overwhelmed. "All of those things."

Jordan smiled. "Perfect. So we need to measure all of those metrics, analyze the data, create a scoring system, and then prioritize based on that. That sounds like a comprehensive approach."

Vincent nodded eagerly. "Yes, exactly!"

Alex leaned back in her chair. "So, to summarize: We need to increase our output by 50% while reducing our budget by 25%, but first we need to spend time and money creating a comprehensive measurement and prioritization system that will help us figure out what to build?"

The room went silent again. Vincent was starting to realize he'd been outmaneuvered.

Mack grinned. "I think what we're learning here is that effective budget planning requires careful analysis and strategic thinking. Maybe we should schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss the measurement framework?"

Vincent looked around the room. Everyone was nodding enthusiastically. "Well, I suppose that makes sense."

Jordan smiled. "Excellent. I'll coordinate with the team to develop a comprehensive proposal for the measurement framework. We should probably also include some time for stakeholder interviews and requirements gathering."

Vincent was now completely lost. "Stakeholder interviews?"

"Of course," Alex said. "We need to understand what each department considers valuable. That will help us create a balanced scoring system."

The meeting devolved into a discussion of measurement frameworks, stakeholder analysis, and strategic planning methodologies. Vincent, who had expected to deliver a simple budget cut, found himself agreeing to a comprehensive analysis that would take weeks to complete.

By the end of the meeting, the engineers had successfully turned a budget cut into a research project. Vincent was nodding along to discussions of "value stream mapping" and "outcome-based metrics," lured by his love of planning.

As they left the conference room, Mack grinned. "Well, that was fun."

Alex nodded. "We just turned a budget cut into a paid research project."

Jordan smiled. "And we made it sound like we were being helpful."

Somewhere in the building, Vincent was still trying to figure out what had just happened.
