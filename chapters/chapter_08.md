# Chapter 8

"MANDATORY: New Code Review Policy - Effective Immediately," Alex read from her screen, groaning as she settled into her desk with her coffee. The email was three pages long and contained phrases like "quality assurance," "knowledge sharing," "best practices," and "innovation culture." She scrolled down to find the actual requirements.

"All code changes must be reviewed by at least two team members before deployment," she read aloud. "Reviewers must provide constructive feedback and ensure code meets ByteSauce standards. Reviews must be completed within 24 hours of submission."

Mack appeared at her desk, carrying his own coffee and looking amused. "You get the email too?"

"Just finished reading it," Alex said. "Apparently, we've been writing bad code this whole time and nobody noticed until now."

Jordan joined them, carrying a notebook and looking thoughtful. "Actually, this could be good for us. If we're reviewing each other's code, we can make sure we're all on the same page about our approach."

"Approach to what?" Mack asked.

"To surviving this place," Jordan said. "If we're all reviewing each other's work, we can make sure we're not accidentally making things too efficient or too reliable."

Alex stared at him. "What are you talking about?"

Jordan smiled. "Think about it. If we make the systems too good, management will expect more. If we make them just good enough to work but not great, we can maintain reasonable expectations."

Mack laughed. "Jordan, you're a genius. We should create a secret code review checklist."

"Secret code review checklist?" Alex said.

"Sure," Mack said. "We can use the comments to communicate with each other. Like, if I see something that's too well-written, I can comment 'Consider adding more complexity here' or 'This might be too efficient for our current architecture.'"

Alex was starting to see the potential. "And if I see something that's actually broken, I can comment 'This looks innovative' or 'Great use of cutting-edge patterns.'"

Jordan nodded. "Exactly. We can use corporate buzzwords to signal to each other what we really mean."

The first code review request came in that afternoon. Mack had submitted a simple bug fix for the login system, and Sarah had assigned Alex and Jordan as reviewers.

Alex opened the pull request and immediately saw the issue. Mack had written clean, efficient code that would actually fix the problem. She started typing her review comments.

"Great work on this fix!" she wrote. "I love how you've leveraged modern patterns here. The error handling is particularly innovative. Consider adding some additional complexity to make this more robust for our enterprise architecture."

Jordan added his own comment: "Excellent use of best practices. I especially appreciate the way you've structured the validation logic. Maybe we could add some additional layers to make this more scalable for future growth."

Mack responded: "Thanks for the feedback! I'll add some more complexity to make this enterprise-ready."

The next day, Jordan submitted a feature for review. It was a simple API endpoint that should have taken about 20 lines of code, but he'd written it in 150 lines with extensive error handling, logging, and "enterprise patterns."

Alex reviewed it and wrote: "This is exactly the kind of robust, enterprise-grade code we need. I love how you've thought through all the edge cases. The logging is particularly comprehensive."

Mack added: "Great work on making this production-ready. I especially like how you've implemented the retry logic and circuit breaker pattern. This shows real attention to scalability."

Sarah was thrilled with the reviews. "This is exactly what I was hoping for!" she said in the team meeting. "The code review process is really improving our code quality and fostering collaboration."

Jordan smiled. "We're all learning so much from each other's approaches."

Alex nodded. "It's amazing how much better our code is getting."

Mack grinned. "I feel like we're really building something special here."

The reviews continued throughout the week, and the team developed an entire secret language in their comments. "Innovative" meant "over-engineered," "enterprise-ready" meant "unnecessarily complex," "scalable" meant "slow," and "robust" meant "hard to maintain."

They also used the reviews to communicate about other things. When Alex wanted to vent about a meeting, she'd add a comment like "This approach reminds me of our recent discussions about process optimization" and Mack would respond with "Absolutely, the parallels are striking."

Jordan used the reviews to practice his diplomatic skills. He'd write comments like "I wonder if we might consider an alternative approach that leverages our existing infrastructure" when he really meant "This is terrible, please rewrite it."

Mack caught on quickly and started using the same language. His reviews became increasingly creative, with comments like "This demonstrates excellent forward-thinking architecture" for code that was clearly over-engineered.

Vincent was pleased with the results. "I can see the innovation culture taking hold," he said in an all-hands meeting. "The code review process is fostering creativity and pushing us to think outside the box."

Alex, Mack, and Jordan exchanged glances. They were definitely thinking outside the box, just not in the way Vincent intended.

The reviews became more elaborate over time. Mack started adding comments in different programming languages, knowing that only the engineers would understand them. Alex developed a system of emoji codes that conveyed her real thoughts about the code.

The team's code became increasingly complex and difficult to maintain, but management was thrilled with the "innovation" and "enterprise patterns" they were seeing. Vincent started mentioning the code review process in his presentations to the board.

"Look at how our engineers are collaborating and innovating," he'd say. "The code review process has transformed our development culture."

The engineers would nod and smile.

Alex looked at her latest review comment with satisfaction: "Great use of design patterns here. Maybe we could add some additional abstraction layers to make this more maintainable for future iterations."

She hit submit and went back to her actual work.
