# Chapter 7

The networking event was being held in a converted warehouse that had been transformed into something the event coordinator called "industrial chic." Exposed brick walls, Edison bulbs hanging from the ceiling, and a bar made from reclaimed wood that looked like it had been expensive to build.

Jordan arrived fifteen minutes early, which gave him time to survey the room and identify the key players before the crowd arrived. He'd learned that the best networking happened in the first thirty minutes, when people were still fresh and hadn't been worn down by small talk.

He spotted Lisa Chen from the Innovation Lab across the room, talking to someone from the marketing department. She was wearing a blazer that probably cost more than his monthly rent and carrying a leather portfolio that matched Sarah's. Corporate middle management had a uniform, and Lisa wore it well.

"Jordan! I didn't expect to see you here."

He turned to find Alex standing behind him, holding a glass of wine that looked like it had been poured from the expensive bottle. She was dressed in what he recognized as her "meeting clothes"—a blazer over a simple blouse, professional but not trying too hard.

"Alex? What brings you to a networking event?"

"Sarah insisted. Said it would be good for 'cross-functional collaboration' and 'building relationships across the organization.'"

Jordan nodded. Sarah was always pushing team members to attend these events, probably because she'd read somewhere that networking was essential for career development. "How's it going so far?"

"I've been here ten minutes and already had three conversations about 'synergy' and 'digital transformation.' I'm considering hiding in the bathroom until it's socially acceptable to leave."

Jordan laughed. "That's why you need a strategy. You can't just show up and hope for the best."

"What's your strategy?"

"Identify the people who can help you, the people who can hurt you, and the people who are just here for the free wine. Then work the room accordingly."

Alex looked around. "How do you tell the difference?"

"Body language, conversation topics, who they're talking to. The people who matter are usually talking to other people who matter. The people who don't matter are usually talking about their weekend plans."

A woman in a business suit approached them, carrying a clipboard and wearing a name tag that identified her as "Jennifer - Event Coordinator."

"Excuse me, are you Jordan Williams? I have you down for the panel discussion on 'Building Effective Cross-Functional Teams.'"

Jordan's smile faltered for just a moment. He'd forgotten about the panel. "That's me. What time does it start?"

"Seven thirty. We have you, Lisa Chen from the Innovation Lab, and David Thompson from HR. Should be a great discussion."

Jordan nodded and thanked her, but his mind was already calculating how to turn this unexpected responsibility into an opportunity. Panel discussions were excellent networking—everyone in the room would be paying attention to what he said.

Alex raised an eyebrow. "Panel discussion? When did you volunteer for that?"

"I didn't. I think Sarah nominated me. She's always trying to get me involved in 'leadership opportunities.'"

"Translation: she wants you to do more work for free."

"Or she wants me to represent the engineering team in a positive light. Either way, it's good exposure."

Alex sipped her wine. "Exposure to what? More meetings and responsibilities?"

"Exposure to people who make decisions about promotions and budgets. You should try it sometime."

"I'd rather write code than talk about writing code."

Jordan spotted Lisa making her way toward them. "Speaking of which, here comes someone who definitely falls into the 'can help you' category."

Lisa arrived with the confidence of someone who'd been to dozens of these events. "Jordan, Alex, great to see you both. I was hoping to catch up with the engineering team."

"Lisa," Jordan said, extending his hand. "How's the Taskly rollout going?"

"Challenging, but we're making progress. The teams are providing excellent feedback that's helping us prioritize our roadmap."

Alex's expression suggested she was translating this as: "Nobody wants to use our system, but we're pretending the complaints are feature requests."

"I've been thinking about how we could improve the adoption process," Jordan said. "Maybe we could set up some working sessions between the Innovation Lab and the engineering teams. Get everyone in the same room to discuss requirements and constraints."

Lisa brightened. "That's exactly the kind of collaboration we need. Would you be interested in helping coordinate those sessions?"

Jordan's smile didn't waver, but Alex could see the moment when he realized he'd just volunteered for more work. "I'd be happy to help facilitate the discussions."

"Perfect. I'll set up a meeting next week to plan the agenda."

As Lisa walked away, Alex turned to Jordan. "You just volunteered to coordinate meetings between the Innovation Lab and engineering teams."

"I was trying to be helpful."

"You were trying to be diplomatic, and it backfired. Again."

Jordan shrugged. "It's not the worst thing that could happen. At least I'll have a say in how the meetings are structured."

"Or you'll spend the next month trying to get people who don't want to work together to work together."

A man in his fifties approached them, wearing a suit that looked expensive and a watch that looked even more expensive. Jordan recognized him as Robert Martinez, the VP of Product Development.

"Jordan Williams, right? I've heard good things about your work on the vendor integration project."

Jordan extended his hand. "Mr. Martinez, pleasure to meet you. The vendor project was a team effort—I just helped coordinate the technical requirements."

"Call me Robert. And don't be modest. I heard you negotiated a 20% reduction in licensing fees while maintaining all the service level agreements."

"That was mostly luck and timing. The vendor was eager to renew, and we had some leverage."

Robert nodded appreciatively. "That's exactly the kind of thinking we need more of around here. Too many people just accept the first offer they get."

Alex watched Jordan work the conversation, asking questions about Robert's background, sharing relevant experiences, and positioning himself as someone who understood both technical and business concerns. It was impressive, even if it felt slightly calculated.

"Have you thought about moving into product management?" Robert asked. "Your technical background combined with your negotiation skills would be valuable."

Jordan's eyes lit up, but he kept his response measured. "I enjoy the technical work, but I'm always interested in opportunities to have more impact on the business side."

"I'll keep that in mind. We're always looking for people who can bridge the gap between engineering and product."

As Robert walked away, Alex turned to Jordan. "Product management? I thought you liked coding."

"I do like coding. But I also like having influence over what gets built and how it gets prioritized."

"Translation: you want to be the person making decisions instead of the person implementing them."

"Maybe. Or maybe I want to be the person who makes sure the right decisions get made."

The event coordinator appeared again. "Jordan, we're ready to start the panel discussion. Could you come to the stage area?"

Jordan excused himself and made his way to the front of the room, where Lisa and David were already seated behind a table with microphones. The audience consisted of about thirty people, mostly middle managers and team leads who'd been encouraged to attend for professional development.

The moderator, a woman from the learning and development team, introduced the panel and asked the first question: "What are the biggest challenges you face when working across different departments?"

Lisa went first, talking about communication gaps and the importance of shared goals. David discussed the need for clear processes and documentation. Jordan waited for his turn, then delivered a response that sounded genuine but had been practiced.

"The biggest challenge is translating between different languages. Engineers speak in terms of technical constraints and implementation details. Business stakeholders speak in terms of market opportunities and revenue impact. My role is to help both sides understand each other's perspectives."

The moderator nodded appreciatively. "That's a great insight. How do you handle situations where the technical reality doesn't match the business expectations?"

Jordan glanced at Lisa, who was probably thinking about the Taskly migration. "Honesty is crucial, but so is finding solutions. Instead of just saying 'that's impossible,' I try to say 'that's challenging, but here are some alternatives that might achieve the same goal.'"

Lisa jumped in. "That's exactly what we're trying to do with the Taskly rollout. We're working with the engineering teams to find ways to meet their needs while still achieving our strategic objectives."

Jordan nodded, even though he knew the engineering teams would disagree with Lisa's characterization of the process.

The discussion continued for another thirty minutes, covering topics like conflict resolution, stakeholder management, and building trust across organizational boundaries. Jordan found himself falling into the rhythm of corporate speak, using phrases like "synergistic collaboration" and "stakeholder alignment" without thinking about what they actually meant.

After the panel ended, several people approached him to ask follow-up questions or share their own experiences. He spent the next hour working the room, collecting business cards and making connections that might be useful later.

Alex found him near the bar, talking to someone from the finance department about budget planning processes.

"How's the networking going?" she asked when the conversation ended.

"Productive. I met the VP of Product Development, got invited to a working group on vendor management, and collected about fifteen business cards."

"Any of them actually useful?"

"Robert Martinez could be helpful if I decide to move into product management. And the vendor management group might give me some influence over which tools we buy."

Alex sipped her wine. "So you're seriously considering leaving engineering?"

"I'm considering all my options. The technical work is interesting, but there's a ceiling on how much impact you can have when you're just implementing other people's decisions."

"What about your side projects? The real estate stuff?"

Jordan's expression shifted slightly. "That's more of a long-term plan. I'm building a network now so that when I'm ready to make a move, I have options."

Alex looked around the room, where people were starting to leave. "This whole thing feels like a game. Everyone pretending to be interested in each other's work while actually just looking for opportunities to advance their own careers."

"It's not a game. It's relationship building. The people who succeed in corporate environments are the ones who understand that everything is connected."

"Or the ones who are good at playing politics."

"Politics is just another word for understanding how organizations work. You can either learn to navigate the system or complain about it."

Alex finished her wine. "I think I'll stick with complaining."

Jordan smiled. "That's why you're good at what you do. You see through the bullshit and call it out."

"Then why are you trying to become part of the bullshit?"

"Because the bullshit is where the decisions get made. You can either be the person who complains about the system or the person who tries to change it from the inside."

Alex set down her glass. "Or you can just do good work and let the results speak for themselves."

"Results don't speak for themselves in corporate environments. They get interpreted by people who don't understand the work. You know how many times I've seen excellent technical solutions get rejected because someone couldn't explain the value to the business?"

"Probably the same number of times I've seen terrible technical solutions get approved because someone could sell them well."

"Exactly. That's the game. The best code in the world doesn't matter if nobody understands why it's valuable."

Alex looked around the room. "So the solution is to become the person who can sell bad ideas well?"

"The solution is to become the person who can sell good ideas well. There's a difference."

"Is there? Look at Taskly. It's objectively worse than what we had, but it's getting pushed through because someone made it sound strategic. The Innovation Lab is just vibe coding their way through the entire project."

Jordan nodded. "And that's exactly why we need more engineers in positions where they can influence decisions. If the people making the calls don't understand the technical reality, they'll keep making bad choices."

"Or maybe the problem is that we're treating software development like a business instead of like engineering."

"Software development is a business. We're not building bridges or designing circuits—we're building products that need to make money and satisfy customers. The technical excellence matters, but so does the business case."

Alex shook her head. "That's what they want you to think. They want you to believe that writing good code isn't enough, that you need to learn their language and play their games."

"Maybe because writing good code isn't enough. Not in a world where the competition is also writing good code. The differentiator is how well you can solve business problems, not just technical ones."

"And the business problems are usually created by people who don't understand the technical constraints."

"Sometimes. But sometimes the technical constraints are artificial. Sometimes the 'impossible' requirements are just difficult, and the business needs someone who can figure out how to make them work."

Alex looked at Jordan for a long moment. "When did you start believing their version of reality?"

"When I realized that my version of reality wasn't getting me anywhere. I can write the cleanest, most elegant code in the world, but if nobody understands why it's better than the quick-and-dirty solution, it doesn't matter."

"Then maybe the problem isn't that engineers need to learn business. Maybe the problem is that business people need to learn engineering."

"Maybe. But I can't change what business people do. I can only change what I do."

Alex stood up. "I should probably head out. I have a code review to finish tonight."

"Of course. Don't let me keep you from your actual work."

As Alex left, Jordan watched her go. She was right about a lot of things—the system was broken, the bullshit was real, and good technical work often got overlooked in favor of well-marketed mediocrity. But she was wrong about one thing: the solution wasn't to opt out of the game. The solution was to get better at playing it.
