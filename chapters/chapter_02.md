# Chapter 2

Sarah's alarm went off at 6:15 AM, but she was already awake. She'd been lying there for twenty minutes, thinking about the Taskly migration and the fourteen forms she needed to distribute by end of day. Her husband, Tom, was still asleep beside her, and she could hear their two kids, Emma and Jake, already arguing about who got to use the bathroom first.

She grabbed her phone and checked her email. Nineteen new messages, all about the Digital Transformation Initiative 2.0. She deleted them all without reading them, then immediately felt guilty. What if one of them was important?

In the kitchen, she made coffee and started packing lunches. Emma wanted a turkey sandwich, no mayo, and Jake would only eat peanut butter and jelly if the crusts were cut off. Tom preferred to buy lunch, but she always packed something for him anyway. It was her way of showing she cared, even when work took up most of her time.

"Mom, I can't find my math homework," Emma called from upstairs.

"It's on the kitchen table," Sarah called back. "Where you left it last night."

"I didn't leave it there!"

Sarah closed her eyes and counted to three. "Check your backpack. The blue folder."

Silence. Then: "Found it!"

She smiled despite herself. Emma was eleven and going through that phase where she was convinced her mother was always wrong about everything. Sarah remembered being the same way at that age.

At 7:30, she kissed Tom goodbye and loaded the kids into the car. The drive to school was always chaotic—Emma needed to be dropped off first, then Jake at his elementary school, then she had to fight traffic to get to the office by 8:30. She'd been doing this routine for five years, and it still felt like a miracle when everyone arrived on time.

"Mom, can I have a sleepover this weekend?" Emma asked from the backseat.

"Ask your father," Sarah said automatically. "I have to work late on Friday."

"Again?" Emma said. "You always have to work late."

Sarah felt a pang of guilt. She did work late a lot. But the Taskly migration was behind schedule, and Vincent was expecting full adoption by the end of the week. She couldn't let her team down.

"Maybe next weekend," she said. "I promise."

Emma didn't respond, but Sarah could see her reflection in the rearview mirror, looking disappointed.

At the office, Sarah arrived at her desk at 8:25, five minutes early as always. She organized her workspace with the precision that had earned her the nickname "The Colonel" among the engineers. Everything had its place—pens in the top drawer, notepads stacked by size, calendar open to today's date. It was the one thing she could control in her chaotic life.

Her first meeting was at 9 AM with Vincent. Sarah had prepared a detailed status report on the Taskly migration, complete with adoption metrics, user feedback, and a timeline for full implementation. She'd spent two hours on it last night after the kids went to bed.

Vincent arrived ten minutes late, carrying his usual cold brew and looking distracted. "Sarah, thanks for coming. I need to talk to you about the Taskly adoption numbers."

Sarah opened her laptop and pulled up the report. "I have the latest metrics here. We're at 85% adoption across the engineering team, which is ahead of our projected timeline."

Vincent waved his hand dismissively. "That's not what I'm concerned about. The board is asking about ROI. They want to see how this investment is paying off."

Sarah felt her stomach clench. "ROI?"

"Return on investment," Vincent said, as if Sarah didn't know what ROI meant. "We spent $2 million developing Taskly. The board wants to see measurable improvements in productivity."

Sarah looked at her report. The adoption numbers were mostly fictional, generated by Mack's script. The actual productivity metrics showed a 30% decrease in output since the migration began, but she couldn't tell Vincent that.

"I can prepare a detailed ROI analysis," Sarah said. "We should see improvements in velocity and throughput once the team fully adapts to the new system."

"Great," Vincent said. "I need that by tomorrow morning. The board meeting is at 10 AM."

After Vincent left, Sarah sat at her desk and stared at her computer screen. She needed to create an ROI report that showed the $2 million investment was paying off, even though the system was making everything slower and more complicated. She couldn't tell Vincent the truth—that Taskly was a disaster and the engineers were actively working around it.

At 11 AM, she had a one-on-one with Michael. He looked exhausted, and she could see the stress in his eyes.

"How are you holding up?" she asked.

Michael sighed. "Honestly? Not great. The team is frustrated with Taskly, and I'm caught between what they need and what management wants."

Sarah nodded. She understood that feeling all too well. "What can I do to help?"

"I don't know. The system keeps crashing, and we're spending more time fighting with it than actually working. But Vincent wants adoption metrics, so they're generating fake data to make it look like everything is working."

Sarah felt a pang of guilt. She was the one who'd pushed for the migration, who'd presented Taskly as the solution to all their problems. She'd believed in it, or at least she'd wanted to believe in it.

"I'll talk to Vincent about extending the timeline," she said. "Maybe we can do a phased rollout instead of forcing everyone to migrate at once."

Michael looked skeptical. "You think that'll work?"

"I don't know," Sarah admitted.

At lunch, Sarah ate at her desk while working on the ROI report. She'd promised Emma she'd try to take a real lunch break, but there was too much work to do. She opened her phone and looked at the family photo on her lock screen—Tom, Emma, and Jake at the beach last summer, all of them smiling. She missed that version of herself, the one who had time to go to the beach and actually enjoy it.

Her phone buzzed with a text from Tom: "How's your day going?"

"Busy," she replied. "How are the kids?"

"Emma's mad because I said no to the sleepover. Jake's fine. When will you be home?"

Sarah looked at her calendar. She had meetings until 6 PM, then she needed to finish the ROI report. "Probably 8. Sorry."

"Again?"

She felt another pang of guilt. "I'll make it up to them this weekend."

"Sarah, you said that last weekend. And the weekend before that."

She didn't respond. What could she say? That she was trying to be a good manager? That she was caught between her team's needs and management's demands? That she was afraid of failing, of letting everyone down?

At 2 PM, she had a team meeting with the engineers. Alex, Mack, and Jordan were there, along with the rest of the team. They all looked tired and frustrated.

"Thanks for coming," Sarah said. "I wanted to check in on how the Taskly migration is going."

"Slowly," Alex said. "The system keeps crashing, and we're losing work every time it does."

Sarah nodded. "I understand there are some technical issues. But we need to push through them. ByteSkip has invested a lot in this system."

"Invested a lot in a system that doesn't work," Mack muttered.

Sarah pretended not to hear. "I'm working on getting you more training and support. In the meantime, please continue with the migration as best you can."

After the meeting, Jordan stayed behind. "Sarah, I know this is difficult for everyone. But I think we can make this work if we approach it differently."

"How so?" she asked.

"Let me talk to IT about a hybrid approach. We can keep using the old system for critical projects while we transition to Taskly gradually. That way, we don't lose productivity while we work out the kinks."

Sarah felt a glimmer of hope. "You think that would work?"

"I do. And it would give us time to fix the real issues with Taskly before forcing everyone to use it."

"Thank you, Jordan," Sarah said. "I appreciate you trying to find a solution."

At 4 PM, she had another meeting with Vincent. This time, it was about the quarterly budget review.

"The board is concerned about our spending," Vincent said. "We need to show that we're being fiscally responsible while still investing in innovation."

Sarah pulled up the budget spreadsheet. "I've identified several areas where we can reduce costs without impacting productivity."

"Good. I need a detailed cost-cutting plan by the end of the week. And make sure it doesn't affect the Taskly rollout."

Sarah nodded, but inside she was screaming. How was she supposed to cut costs while forcing everyone to use an expensive system that didn't work?

At 6 PM, she was still at her desk, working on the ROI report. The office was mostly empty, and she could hear the cleaning crew starting their rounds. Her phone buzzed again—Tom asking if she was coming home for dinner.

"Working late," she replied. "Don't wait up."

"Sarah, the kids miss you."

"I know. I miss them too."

"Then come home. The work will still be there tomorrow."

But it wouldn't. Vincent needed the ROI report by tomorrow morning, and the board meeting was at 10 AM. If she didn't deliver, she'd look incompetent. And if she looked incompetent, she might lose her job. And if she lost her job, how would they pay for Emma's private school and Jake's soccer lessons and the mortgage on their house?

At 8 PM, she finally finished the ROI report. It was mostly fiction, showing impressive productivity gains and cost savings that didn't actually exist. But it was what Vincent wanted, what the board wanted, what everyone wanted to hear.

She packed up her laptop and headed for the elevator. The building was quiet now, and her footsteps echoed in the empty hallway. She thought about Emma and Jake, probably already in bed, and Tom, probably watching TV alone. She thought about the family vacation they'd planned for spring break, and how she'd probably have to cancel it because of work.

Her phone buzzed. It was Tom again: "Are you okay?"

"I'm fine," she replied. "Just tired."

"Come home. We love you."

Sarah stepped into the elevator and pressed the button for the lobby. As the doors closed, she caught a glimpse of her reflection in the mirrored wall. She looked exhausted, and older than she remembered.
