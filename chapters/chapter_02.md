# Chapter 2: The JIRA Incident

Monday morning, Alex arrived at her desk to find a new laptop sitting there, along with a stack of documentation and a note from Sarah. "Please migrate all your current projects to Taskly by end of day. Training session at 10 AM."

She opened the laptop and stared at the login screen. The Taskly logo looked suspiciously familiar.

Mack dropped into the chair next to her, carrying his own new laptop. "What the hell is a Taskly?"

"Apparently we're migrating to an internal JIRA today," Alex said. "All projects need to be moved by end of day."

"End of day?" Mack said. "We have what, eight hours to move everything?"

"Seven and a half, actually," Alex said, checking her watch. "Training session at 10."

Jordan appeared behind them, carrying his laptop and a notebook. "I just got off the phone with IT. They're saying this is mandatory."

"Of course it is," Mack said. "When has anything been optional around here?"

Alex logged into the new system and immediately noticed something odd. The interface looked like it had been built by someone who'd never used a project management tool before. The navigation was counterintuitive, the search function was buried three levels deep, and there was no way to bulk-edit tasks.

"Who built this thing?" she muttered, clicking through the menus.

Mack was already typing furiously on his laptop. "I'm trying to figure out how to export our current data. This system is a nightmare."

Jordan was taking notes in his notebook. "I see some potential issues here. Let me make a few calls."

The training session at 10 AM was led by Lisa Chen from the Innovation Lab. She was enthusiastic about the new system, which made Alex immediately suspicious.

"Taskly was built by our own engineers," Lisa said proudly. "It's designed specifically for our workflow and integrates perfectly with our existing tools."

Alex raised her hand. "What existing tools? We're not using any of the tools it's supposed to integrate with."

Lisa's smile didn't waver. "That's exactly why we need this migration! Taskly will help us standardize our processes and improve our efficiency."

"Right," Mack said under his breath. "Because nothing says 'efficiency' like learning a new system that doesn't work."

The training session lasted two hours and covered approximately none of the things they actually needed to know. Lisa spent most of the time talking about the system's "revolutionary features", like AI summaries, while the engineers tried to figure out how to create a simple task.

"Let me show you how to create a new project," Lisa said, clicking through the interface with practiced ease. "First, you navigate to the project creation wizard..."

Alex watched as she clicked through seven different screens to create a project that should have taken three clicks. By the time she finished, she'd already calculated that this system would add approximately 15 minutes to every task creation.

"Now, let's look at the reporting features," Lisa continued. "Taskly provides comprehensive analytics that will help us track our velocity and throughput."

Jordan was asking questions about the integration capabilities. "What about our existing data? How do we migrate our current projects?"

"Excellent question," Lisa said. "We have a migration tool that will help you transfer your existing work. It's very straightforward."

Alex tried the migration tool. It crashed after processing three tasks.

"Straightforward," she said to Mack, rolling her eyes.

Back at their desks, Mack was already working on a solution. "I'm building a script to auto-generate tasks," he said. "If they want us to use this system, I'll give them what they want."

"Won't that get you in trouble?" Alex asked.

"Only if they figure out it's fake," Mack said. "And since they don't understand the system anyway, they'll never know the difference."

Jordan was on the phone with IT. "Yes, I understand the concerns about the migration timeline. Let me see if I can help smooth this transition for everyone."

Alex spent the next hour trying to migrate their current projects. The system crashed four times, lost data twice, and required her to re-enter the same information three times. By lunch, she'd successfully migrated exactly one project, and it had taken her three hours.

"Progress report," Michael said, appearing at her desk. "How's the migration going?"

"Slowly," Alex said. "The system keeps crashing and losing data."

Michael nodded sympathetically. "That's normal during the initial setup. The system needs time to learn your workflow."

"Learn my workflow?" Alex said. "It's a project management system. It should already know how to manage projects."

"Taskly is different," Michael said. "It's adaptive. It learns from your usage patterns and optimizes itself accordingly."

Alex stared at him. "So it's a project management system that doesn't know how to manage projects until you teach it?"

"Exactly!" Michael said, clearly missing the sarcasm. "That's what makes it revolutionary."

After lunch, Mack had his script working. "Watch this," he said, running the program. "I can now create a hundred tasks in about thirty seconds."

Alex watched as the script automatically generated tasks with realistic names, descriptions, and story points. "Fix typo on homepage - 8 points," "Rewrite report generation backend - 1 point,", "Implement new authentication - 13 points."

"That's impressive," she said. "But what about the actual work?"

"What about it?" Mack said. "The work gets done. The system gets its metrics. Everyone's happy."

Jordan returned from his meeting with IT. "Good news," he said. "I've negotiated a phased migration approach. We can keep using the old system for critical projects while we transition to Taskly."

"How did you manage that?" Alex asked.

"I explained the risks of forcing a full migration on such a tight timeline," Jordan said. "They seemed very receptive to the idea of a more gradual approach."

"Receptive," Mack said, grinning. "They realized this was going to be a disaster."

By 4 PM, Alex had successfully migrated three projects. The system had crashed seven times, and she'd spent more time fighting with the interface than actually working. She opened her email and found seventeen messages from Michael about the migration progress.

"Status update," Michael said, appearing at her desk again. "How many projects have you migrated?"

"Three," Alex said.

Michael's smile faltered slightly. "Three? We were expecting at least ten by now."

"Ten?" Alex said. "Each project takes about an hour to migrate, and the system crashes every fifteen minutes. Three is actually pretty good."

Michael made a note in his notebook. "I'll need to report this to Vincent. He's expecting full migration by end of day."

"Good luck with that," Alex said.

At 5 PM, Vincent appeared in the engineering area. He looked around at the engineers, most of whom were still working on their migrations.

"How's the Taskly migration going?", he said.

Sarah stepped forward. "We're making excellent progress. The team is adapting well to the new system."

"Excellent," Vincent said. "I want to see the adoption metrics by tomorrow morning."

After Vincent left, Alex looked at Mack. "Adoption metrics?"

"Already on it," Mack said. "My script is generating login data, task creation data, and usage analytics. By tomorrow morning, we'll have the best adoption metrics in the company."
